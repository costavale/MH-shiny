The Ischia Island represents the emerged part of a large volcanic field, extending from the Procida island to the submerged volcanoes of the western Ischia offshore. The volcanic field develops over an area of about 42 km2, E-W trending, composed of calderas, such as the Ischia caldera, linked to the great explosive eruptions, plinian and ignimbritic (“Sintema del Rifugio di S. Nicola”). The grain-size analyses of sea bottom samples have shown that gravelly sands, sands, silty sands, muddy sands, sandy silts, and silts all occur. The comparison of the obtained results with previous sedimentological data collected in the Ischia offshore, coupled with the construction of marine geological maps at the 1:10,000 scale, has shown that sands seem to prevail in the eastern Ischia offshore, while gravelly sands, mainly bioclastic, are located at the top of relict volcanic edifices, such as the Forio Bank (western Ischia offshore) and the Ischia Bank (south-eastern Ischia offshore). Moreover, the obtained data show that rhodolith beds occur on the relict volcanic edifice of the Ischia Bank, on the related parasitic vent, and in the Ischia Channel, a morphological saddle located between the Ischia and Procida islands. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,Buildings; Deposits; Geology; Offshore oil well production; Silt; Volcanoes; Explosive eruption; Geological data; Geological map; Grain size analysis; Marine deposits; Sedimentological data; Southern Tyrrhenian Sea; Volcanic edifice; Sand; coastal zone; geological survey; marine sediment; Quaternary; seafloor; sedimentology; volcanic eruption; Campania [Italy]; Gulf of Naples; Ischia; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Napoli [Campania]; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,environmental,,,,,

In the seismic sections, the core bottom corresponds to the top of a continuous and parallel reflector (V) interbedded within the transgressive deposits of the Late Quaternary-Holocene depositional sequence. The Transgressive System Tract deposits are particularly thick compared to the majority of the transgressive deposits of other shelf settings. This might be due to the input of pyroclastic and volcaniclastic deposits related to the intense eruptive activity of the Campania Plain during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene time span. Undulations and pockmarks are the main morphological features of the sea floor and they might be linked to gas uprising, widely detected in the study area.

This reconstruction has provided new insights into the knowledge of marine geophysics and volcanology of Vesuvius, one of most studied volcanoes in the world. Seismic stratigraphy of the volcanic structures shows acoustically-transparent seismic faciès and high contrasts of acoustic impedance with respect to the overlying sediments. The structures have mound-shaped external geometry and average dimensions measurable in terms of kilometres. The base of the Torre del Greco volcanic structure overlies the volcanic seismic unit correlated to the 'Campanian Ignimbrite' pyroclastic flow deposits. Consequently, no contrast of acoustic impedance between the two volcanic units is clearly evident on the seismic profiles. The top of the structure is irregular and eroded and shows several culminations. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the Torre del Greco structure has been carried out using seismic constraints and correlations of volcanic structure to bathymetry. The sea floor topography is compared to the top of the Torre del Greco volcanic structure represented by contour depth of corresponding seismic horizons. Proceeding from south-east to north-west there is a good correspondence between the sea floor topographic surface and the top of the volcanic structure, which does not crop out at the sea-bottom. The rising of the volcanic structure in proximity to the sea-bottom corresponds to the occurrence of topographic undulations of up to ten metres. This evidence is confirmed by the interpretation of seismic profiles, showing three main vertical culminations of the volcanic structure, where the overlying sediment drape is significantly reduced. These culminations are linked to magnetic anomaly extremes, having values ranging between 250-350 nT. A striking coincidence between the long-shaped topographic high on the sea floor (towards the east) and the high in the top of the volcanic structure underneath can be explained as a consequence of sea floor deformation due to the underlying volcanic culminations. Smaller volcanic mounds, buried and fossilized by marine sediments, are not related to any magnetic anomaly, probably due to their composition of volcanic tuffs. © 2010 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.",NA,crustal deformation; data interpretation; geophysics; magnetic anomaly; magnetic method; pyroclastic deposit; pyroclastic flow; reconstruction; seafloor; seismic method; seismic stratigraphy; three-dimensional modeling; vertical seismic profile; volcanology; Campania [Italy]; Gulf of Naples; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Napoli [Campania]; Tyrrhenian Sea; Vesuvius,Article,Scopus,Torre del Greco,40.749703,14.376169,100,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Neapolitan,environmental,,,,,

This approach has been tested in the Aeolian Islands and the Tyrrhenian Sea using juvenile clasts in pyroclastic fall and flow deposits. Geochemical data are used to link marine tephras in the Marsili Basin (core TIR2000-C01) to explosive eruptions of (1) Lipari (Monte Pilato; 776. cal. AD); (2) Vulcano; and (3) Campi Flegrei (Soccavo 1; 11,915-12,721. cal. years BP). Whether a polymictic coarse grained volcaniclastic turbidite in the Marsili Basin originated from collapse on Salina remains unresolved because multi-elemental analysis raises doubt about the published correlation to the Pollara region.It is evident that correlation of proximal continental and distal marine tephras, at a high level of confidence, requires a full complement of major, minor and trace element data. In conjunction with considerations of the mineralogy and morphology of juvenile deposits these data help define petrological lineages such that precise provenance can be established. Whilst a precise proximal-distal match must be based on identical major, minor and trace element concentrations it is clear that resurgent activity from a single volcano can produce magmas with identical compositions. In such cases stratigraphic relationships must complement any geochemical study. Occasionally proximal stratigraphies may be unrepresentative of the complete eruptive history because of a lack of exposure due to burial by more recent effusive and explosive activity, or sector collapse which can remove vital stratigraphy particularly on volcanic islands. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Aeolian Islands; Glass chemistry; Marsili Basin; Tephra; Trace element,Aeolian Islands; Campi Flegrei; Coarse-grained; Eruptive history; Explosive activity; Explosive eruption; Geochemical data; Glass chemistry; Marsili Basin; Multi-elemental analysis; Sector collapse; Southern Tyrrhenian Sea; Tephra; Tephra deposits; Tephras; Tephrochronology; Trace element analysis; Trace element concentrations; Tyrrhenian Sea; Volcanic glass; Volcanic islands; Volcaniclastics; Crystallography; Deposits; Geochemistry; Glass; Mineralogy; Minerals; Trace elements; Volcanoes; Stratigraphy; concentration (composition); explosive volcanism; geochemistry; tephra; trace element; volcanic eruption; volcanic glass; volcanic island; Italy; Lipari Islands; Marsili Basin; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Marsili,39.26,14.378,3180,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

These deposits are hosted in calc-alkaline volcanic rocks emplaced as a result of three successive magma pulses in an emergent volcanic edifice: submarine rhyolitic to rhyodacitic cryptodomes at ca. 2.7. Ma (Profitis Ilias-Chondro Vouno), submarine to subaerial andesite to dacite domes at ca. 2.2 to 1.5. Ma (Triades-Galana-Kondaros-Katsimouti-Vani). Hydrothermal alteration of the volcanic rocks includes advanced argillic- (both hypogene and steam-heated), argillic, phyllic, adularia-sericite and propylitic types. In the northern sector (Triades-Galana-Agathia-Kondaros), initial magma degassing derived from andesitic-dacitic intrusives along NE-SW to E-W trending faults resulted in the development of pre-ore hypogene advanced argillic alteration (dickite, alunite, ± diaspore, pyrophyllite, halite, and pyrite) in a submarine environment. Mineralogical data indicate common features among the Profitis Ilias-Chondro Vouno, Kondaros-Katsimoutis-Vani and Triades-Galana mineralized centers, all of which are characterized by the presence of galena, Fe-poor sphalerite, and chalcopyrite as well as abundant barite, adularia, sericite and, to a lesser extent, calcite, which are typical of intermediate-sulfidation epithermal type deposits. Locally, at Triades-Galana and Kondaros-Agathia, high-sulfidation conditions prevailed as suggested by the presence of coexisting enargite and covellite. The high silver and gold content of the western Milos deposits is derived from Ag-bearing sulfosalts (polybasite, pearceite, pyrargyrite, freibergite) and tellurides. Gold at Profitis Ilias, both as native gold and silver-gold tellurides, is present in base-metal precipitates within multicomponent blebs, which recrystallized to form hessite, petzite, altaite, coloradoite, and native gold. Mineralogical evidence (e.g. microchimney structures, copper sulfides, widespread occurrence of barite, aragonite) suggests that precious metal mineralization in western Milos mineralization formed in a submarine setting. We present information on the surface distribution of Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Sb, Hg, Mo, Bi, W and Cd at western Milos. Gold is enriched at Profitis Ilias-Chondro Vouno deposits and to a lesser extent at Triades-Galana. Arsenic is absent from the southern sector but shows elevated concentrations together with molybdenum, bismuth and tungsten at the northern sector (Triades-Galana, Vani deposits). The differences in precious and base metal abundances may be related to the depths at which the deposits are exposed, and/or different sources of magma. The metal signatures of the Triades-Galana and Agathia-Kondaros-Katsimouti-Vani (Mo-Bi-W-As-Hg-Ag-Au) occurrences compared to Profitis Ilias (Te-Au-Ag) reflect different sources of magma (dacite-rhyodacite for Profitis Ilias, andesite-dacite for Triades-Galana, and dacite for Kondaros-Katsimoutis). The enrichment of Te, Mo, W, and Bi in the deposits is a strong indication of a direct magmatic contribution of these metals. At western Milos, precious and base-metal vein mineralization was deposited during episodic injection of magmatic volatiles and dilution of the hydrothermal fluids by seawater. The mineralization represents seafloor/sub-seafloor precipitation of sulfides that formed in stockwork zones. Base and precious metal mineralization formed from intermediate- to high-sulfidation state fluids and mostly under boiling conditions as indicated by the widespread occurrence of adularia associated with metallic mineralization. We speculate that the widespread occurrence of boiling and the shallow depth of the precious- and base-metal emplacement prevented the formation of seafloor massive sulfides. © 2013.",Aegean Volcanic Arc; Gold; Submarine epithermal; Tellurides; Western Milos Island,Elevated concentrations; Epithermal; Hydrothermal alterations; Seafloor massive sulfides; Surface distributions; Tellurides; Volcanic arc; Western Milos Island; Barite; Bismuth; Deposits; Economic geology; Feldspar; Gold; Kaolinite; Lead; Mercury (metal); Metals; Mineralogy; Molybdenum; Molybdenum deposits; Phase transitions; Seawater; Silver; Silver alloys; Silver deposits; Submarines; Sulfide minerals; Tellurium compounds; Tungsten; Tungsten deposits; Volcanic rocks; Zinc; Zinc sulfide; Gold deposits; base metal; copper; emplacement; epithermal deposit; geochemistry; gold; lead; massive sulfide; mineralization; mineralogy; precious metal; seafloor; silver; telluride; volcanic rock; zinc; Greece; Hellenic Arc; Mediterranean Sea; Milos [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,32,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

In a depression close to Bottaro Islet (PEG1) the gas flowed violently from the depth of ~14m to the surface producing a large plume of gas and fluids. The aims of this paper are to report on the morphological modifications, the water and gas fluxes, and the water dynamics and hydrological properties near the PEG1 site. Bathymetric surveys up to 2006 and divers' observations up to 2008 revealed that the sinkhole had been partially filled by sediments transported by currents or sliding from the rims. Depth reduced to ~12m and the shape of the depression was becoming similar to the others in the area, suggesting that explosive gas eruptions may have occurred in the past. The gas outflow generated a bubble plume that locally affected the water circulation. Different patterns in the dynamics of the water column were described using rotor current meters, ADCP, ROV and divers' observations, and high-resolution bathymetry. A divergence about 1m thick was generated by a surface vortex visible in December 2002 that was not found in September 2003 with reduced gas flow. A sub-surficial layer down to ~1-2m above bottom showed varying speed and directions possibly correlated to tides. A bottom layer of water ~1m thick flowed continuously toward the crater during both surveys. On the nearby sandy bottoms, sand dunes and 2/4mm size volcanoclastic gravels rolling toward the emitting area were found. The fluxes of water entering at the seafloor were calculated by current velocities, height of the bottom layer, and area of the degassing vent. The input water fluxes were found to be 4.2 and 0.2×108l/d, for December 2002 and September 2003. The total vertical output flux was also estimated; considering bubble sizes and voids, gas fluxes were 2.6 and 0.3×108l/d. These values are similar to the fluxes calculated by geochemical and gas sampling methods. CTD data from summer 2003 and spring 2004 recorded pH anomalies with values as low as 6.3 located on main emissions. The low pH water was also distributed laterally for dozens of meters on the bottom, depicting plumes and bottom layers of altered seawater over remarkable distances. The gas burst generated a plume similar to what is described for double core bubble plumes, where the velocity of seawater entering the system is proportional to the vertical gas flux. A new perspective to monitor vent activity is envisaged, and since measuring seawater is easier than measuring gas fluxes, a continuous and real time monitoring of hydrothermal activity could be designed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Aeolian Islands; Bubble plumes; Gas eruption; Panarea; Seafloor morphology; Shallow water vents,bathymetric survey; caldera; carbon dioxide; current velocity; degassing; explosive volcanism; gas flow; hydrothermal activity; outflow; pH; plume; real time; seafloor; seawater; sediment transport; sinkhole; sliding; submarine volcano; venting; volcaniclastic deposit; water column; water flow; Italy; Lipari Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Panarea; Sicily,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.6583,15.1,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The source formed a caldera south of Kos, in the Aegean Sea, Greece. Textural and lithofacies characteristics of the KPT units are used to infer eruption dynamics and magma chamber processes, including the timing for the onset of catastrophic caldera collapse. The KPT consists of six units: (A) phreatoplinian fallout at the base; (B, C) stratified pyroclastic-density-current deposits; (D, E) volumetrically dominant, massive, non-welded ignimbrites; and (F) stratified pyroclastic-density-current deposits and ash fallout at the top. The ignimbrite units show increases in mass, grain size, abundance of vent- and conduit-derived lithic clasts, and runout of the pyroclastic density currents from source. Ignimbrite formation also corresponds to a change from phreato-magmatic to dry explosive activity. Textural and lithofacies characteristics of the KPT imply that the mass flux (i.e. eruption intensity) increased to the climax when major caldera collapse was initiated and the most voluminous, widespread, lithic-rich and coarsest ignimbrite was produced, followed by a waning period. During the eruption climax, deep basement lithic clasts were ejected, along with andesitic pumice and variably melted and vesiculated co-magmatic granitoid clasts from the magma chamber. Stratigraphic variations in pumice vesicularity and crystal content, provide evidence for variations in the distribution of crystal components and a subsidiary andesitic magma within the KPT magma chamber. The eruption climax culminated in tapping more coarsely crystal-rich magma. Increases in mass flux during the waxing phase is consistent with theoretical models for moderate-volume explosive eruptions that lead to caldera collapse.

A dozen cores from the Cretan Basin, south of Santorini, have sampled two megabeds that consist of gravity emplaced volcaniclastic sequences. The uppermost megabed U consists of a succession of five (U5-U1) base cut out turbiditic units. Lower megabed A is a single turbiditic event. Only the uppermost U2 and U1 turbidites are separated from the underlying beds by hemipelagic marls. The texture and composition of the U and A megabeds closely match the texture and composition of the fine, vitric ash of the ""Minoan"" deposits on Santorini islands, dating from about 3500 yr BP. These megabeds are therefore attributed to rapid accumulation of separate gravity flows fed by the ""Minoan"" eruption, except for the upper U2 and U1 turbidites deposited from subsequent gravity flows transporting eroded volcaniclastic sediments. With the exception of the margin south of Santorini, dozens of cores retrieved around the margins of the Cretan Basin have a continuous late Quaternary succession that shows no evidence for massive sediment remobilization into the deeper basin, including the passage of the ""Minoan"" tsunami. Extensive high-resolution 3.5 kHz records revealed the acoustic character, architecture and distribution of the U and A megabeds and four underlying late Quaternary volcanogenic megabeds in the Cretan Basin. The acoustic facies of megabeds are typical of megaturbidites and consist of an upper, transparent, lower velocity layer that corresponds to the fine-grained upper turbiditic silt and clay section and a lower, strongly reflective higher velocity section that corresponds to the lowest, coarser-grained base of the turbidite that is developed over a sharp erosional surface. Penetration of the high-resolution records reveals the existence of at least six megabeds. Correlation with core lithology and the physical properties of the various lithofacies, including down-core velocity profiles, has allowed us to determine the thickness and volumes of the upper four megabeds which are: U = 9 m thick, volume 3.7 km3; A = 25 m thick, volume 12.2 km3; B = 22 m thick, volume 10.3 km3; C = 15 m thick, volume 8 km3. These thick megabeds are the uppermost products of repeated explosive eruption of Santorini in the late Quaternary. Calculated sedimentation rates from and after the ""Minoan"" eruption are 9.4 m/1000 yr that rise to over 15.7 m/1000 yr if megabed B was also deposited during this eruption. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Ancient populations settled this region since historical times, building coastal installations which currently are valuable archaeological indicators of relative sea level changes and vertical land movements. In this study we show and discuss data on the relative sea level change estimated from a submerged wharf of Roman age dated between 50 B.C. and 50 A.D., located at Basiluzzo Island. This structure has been studied through marine surveys and archaeological interpretations and is presently located at a corrected depth of -4.10 ± 0.2 m. We explain this submergence by a cumulative effect of the relative sea level change caused by the regional glacio-hydro-isostatic signal, active since the end of the last glacial maximum, and the local volcano-tectonic land subsidence. Finally, a total subsidence rate of 2.05 ± 0.1 mm/yr-1, with a volcano-tectonic contribution of 1.43 ± 0.1 mm/yr-1 for the last 2 ka BP, is inferred from the comparison against the latest predicted sea level curve for the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, suggesting new evaluations of the volcano-tectonic hazard for this area of the Aeolian islands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",Aeolian islands; Land subsidence; Maritime archaeology; Sea level change,archaeology; eolian deposit; paleoenvironment; sea level change; submergence; subsidence; tectonic evolution; tectonic setting; vertical movement; Basiluzzo; Italy; Lipari Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.6583,15.1,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

A geochemical survey of thermal waters collected from submarine vents at Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) was carried out in 2015 (15–17th June and 17–18th November), in order to investigate the concentration of Hg species in hydrothermal fluids and the vertical distribution in the overlying water column close to the submarine exhalative area. Specific sampling methods were employed by Scuba divers at five submarine vents located along the main regional tectonic lines. The analysis of the hydrothermal fluids indicates a site-to-site variation, with filtered total mercury (FTHg) concentrations ranging from 1072 to 4711 pM, as a consequence of the gas bubbles partial dissolution. These results are three orders of magnitude higher than the FTHg concentrations found in the overlying seawater column (ranging from 5.3 to 6.3 pM in the mid waters), where the efficient currents and vertical mixing result in more dilution, and potentially rapid transfer of the dissolved gaseous Hg to the atmosphere. Dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) were simultaneously measured and combined in a gas-exchange model to calculate the sea-air Hg0 evasional flux. Based on the data of DGM (range: 0.05–0.22 pM) and atmospheric GEM (range: 1.7 ± 0.35–6.4 ± 2.6 ng m- 3), we argue that the surface seawater off Panarea is mostly supersaturated in dissolved elemental gaseous mercury compared to the atmosphere, with a sea-air Hg0 net flux ranging from 0.7 to 9.1 ng m-2 h- 1 (average: ~ 4.5 ± 3.5 ng m-2 h- 1). Since the empirical gas-exchange model does not include the contribution of Hg0 released as gas bubbles rising from the vents toward sea-surface, the calculated Hg0 evasional flux for this location is most likely larger. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Air-sea exchange; Dissolved gaseous mercury; Hydrothermal fluids; Mercury evasion; Panarea Island,air-sea interaction; dissolved gas; gas exchange; hydrochemistry; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal vent; mercury (element); sea surface; seawater; thermal water; underwater environment; Aeolian Arc; Italy; Lipari Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Panarea; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.6583,15.1,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The textural features and chemical zoning (i.e., An content and Fe, Mg, Sr and Ba concentrations) of the plagioclases from each sample show that aggregation of various generations of crystals occurred in the host melt prior to eruption. Plagioclases resulting from crystallisation in small sill intrusions, where local flotation of plagioclase may have occurred, are ubiquitous. Instead, large (up to 1mm) homogeneous An-rich plagioclases are rare and have only been found in two of the studied basalts, recovered from the northern and southern portions of the volcano, respectively. These crystals record crystallisation events occurring long before eruption, and probably derive from deep-seated crystalline material. At the highest An values, the Sr and Ba concentrations of the studied plagioclases also indicate the existence of two distinct mafic magmas within the lower crustal plumbing system of the Marsili volcano, one with lower Sr and Ba contents than the other. Three of the four studied basalts came from magma with low Sr and Ba, whereas the fourth, which erupted from the southern portion of the volcano, sampled magma richer in Sr and Ba. The ascent of magma caused resorption of the previously formed plagioclase crystals and regrowth of normally or inversely zoned portions, depending on the water-saturated or water-undersaturated conditions of the surrounding magma, respectively. Small shallow magmatic reservoirs may be located under the southern part of the Marsili volcano, as testified by the resorbed sodic cores (An 52-57) found in the two basalt samples from this portion. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Basalt; LA-ICP-MS; Marsili seamount; Plagioclase; Southern Tyrrhenian,Back-arc; Chemical zoning; La-ICP-MS; Magma emplacement; Marsili seamount; Plagioclase; Plagioclase crystals; Plumbing Systems; Southern Tyrrhenian; Spreading ridge; Textural feature; Barium; Basalt; Crystalline materials; Flotation; Reservoirs (water); Submarine geology; Volcanoes; Feldspar; concentration (composition); crystallization; emplacement; geological record; igneous intrusion; inductively coupled plasma method; magma; oceanic crust; plagioclase; seafloor spreading; seamount; submarine ridge; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Marsili,39.26,14.378,3180,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The selection of tolerant or vulnerable species can also occur during settlement phases, especially for calcifying organisms which are more vulnerable to low pH–high pCO2 conditions. Here, we use three natural CO2 vents (Castello Aragonese north and south sides, and Vullatura, Ischia, Italy) to assess the effect of a decrease of seawater pH on the settlement of Mollusca in Posidonia oceanica meadows, and to test the possible buffering effect provided by the seagrass. Artificial collectors were installed and collected after 33 days, during April–May 2019, in three different microhabitats within the meadow (canopy, bottom/rhizome level, and dead matte without plant cover), following a pH decreasing gradient from an extremely low pH zone (pH &lt; 7.4), to ambient pH conditions (pH = 8.10). A total of 4659 specimens of Mollusca, belonging to 57 different taxa, were collected. The number of taxa was lower in low and extremely low pH conditions. Reduced mollusc assemblages were reported at the acidified stations, where few taxa accounted for a high number of individuals. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in mollusc assemblages among pH conditions, microhabitat, and the interaction of these two factors. Acanthocardia echinata, Alvania lineata, Alvania sp. juv, Eatonina fulgida, Hiatella arctica, Mytilys galloprovincialis, Musculus subpictus, Phorcus sp. juv, and Rissoa variabilis were the species mostly found in low and extremely low pH stations, and were all relatively robust to acidified conditions. Samples placed on the dead matte under acidified conditions at the Vullatura vent showed lower diversity and abundances if compared to canopy and bottom/rhizome samples, suggesting a possible buffering role of the Posidonia on mollusc settlement. Our study provides new evidence of shifts in marine benthic communities due to ocean acidification and evidence of how P. oceanica meadows could mitigate its effects on associated biota in light of future climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in mollusc assemblages among pH conditions, microhabitat, and the interaction of these two factors.

Samples placed on the dead matte under acidified conditions at the Vullatura vent showed lower diversity and abundances if compared to canopy and bottom/rhizome samples, suggesting a possible buffering role of the Posidonia on mollusc settlement.

The selection of tolerant or vulnerable species can also occur during settlement phases, especially for calcifying organisms which are more vulnerable to low pH–high pCO2 conditions. Here, we use three natural CO2 vents (Castello Aragonese north and south sides, and Vullatura, Ischia, Italy) to assess the effect of a decrease of seawater pH on the settlement of Mollusca in Posidonia oceanica meadows, and to test the possible buffering effect provided by the seagrass. Artificial collectors were installed and collected after 33 days, during April–May 2019, in three different microhabitats within the meadow (canopy, bottom/rhizome level, and dead matte without plant cover), following a pH decreasing gradient from an extremely low pH zone (pH &lt; 7.4), to ambient pH conditions (pH = 8.10). A total of 4659 specimens of Mollusca, belonging to 57 different taxa, were collected. The number of taxa was lower in low and extremely low pH conditions.

Microbial oxidation of the methane released can trigger the precipitation of carbonate within sediments and support a broad diversity of seafloor ecosystems(3,4). The factors controlling microbial activity and carbonate precipitation associated with the seepage of submarine fluid over geological time remain poorly constrained. Here, we characterize the petrology and geochemistry of rocks sampled from metre-size build-ups of methane-derived carbonate chimneys located at the Amon mud volcano on the Nile deep-sea fan. We find that these carbonates comprise porous structures composed of aggregated spherules of aragonite, and closely resemble microbial carbonate reefs forming at present in the anoxic bottom waters of the Black Sea(5). Using U-series dating, we show that the Amon carbonate build-ups formed between 12 and 7 thousand years ago, contemporaneous with the deposition of organic-rich sediments in the eastern Mediterranean, the so-called sapropel layer S1. We propose that the onset of deep-water suboxic or anoxic conditions associated with sapropel formation resulted in the development of intense anaerobic microbial activity at the sea floor, and thus the formation of carbonate chimneys.",NA,AUTHIGENIC CARBONATE; ANAEROBIC OXIDATION; HYDROCARBON SEEPS; HYDRATE RIDGE; BUILD-UPS; METHANE; FLUID; COMMUNITIES; MARGIN; MATS,Article,WOS,Amon,32.3708,31.7139,1120,Mud Volcano,Egypt,methane-hydrocarbon,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,environmental,,,,,

The settling particles collected differed between sites not only in quantity but also in their geochemical composition. In the area directly influenced by warm water vents, the vertical flux of particulate material was almost one order of magnitude higher than that observed at the reference sites 6.5 km away from the vents, with a higher contribution of biogenic material in the former. The neutral lipid fractions exhibited a significant zooplankton biomarker signature (e.g. cholesterol and wax esters), followed by those of microalgal and terrigenous remains. The biogeochemical cycle of sterols included the formation of steroidal ketones, thiols and stanols, the latter two particularly associated with the venting activity. Moreover, the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the particles from the venting area reflected a locally enhanced maturity of the organic matter. Although part of the material collected in the traps may have been exported in the vent waters, the higher fluxes observed in the vicinity of the hydrothermal plumes are mainly the result of an assemblage of zooplankton which, in turn, may contribute significantly to the sedimentation, through fast sinking faecal pellets, of the petrogenic hydrocarbons possibly generated in the vents. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There was no significant difference in the range of 210Po specific activities measured in particulate material collected by sediment traps in a control area and in the vent area; the resultant 210Po levels were of the same order of magnitude as literature values reported for other Mediterranean coastal areas. 210Pb levels in sinking particles from the control site tended to be higher than those measured in the vent zone, as demonstrated by the lower 210Po/210Pb ratios observed in particles from the control site. Nevertheless, these 210Pb levels were also comparable with similar 210Pb data reported for the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The 210Po and 210Pb vertical particulate fluxes were, on average, higher in the vent zone as a consequence of the higher particle flux. This observation indicates that vents can indirectly control the flux of these natural radionuclides by affecting the types and amount of particles produced in hydrothermal areas. The 210Po levels measured in a gastropod and a bivalve living on or near the microbial mat in the vent zone were higher than values reported for non-vent gastropods and bivalves from the NW Mediterranean Sea, an observation which suggests that an enhanced food chain transfer of 210Po may occur in the vicinity of vents off Milos Island. Nevertheless, the lack of a general enhancement of 210Po and 210Pb in the marine particulate samples collected indicates that any input of these radionuclides through venting activity may have a minimal effect in the surrounding environment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Food chain transport; Molluscs; Natural radioactivity; Particle flux,lead; polonium; sulfur; lead 210; polonium; animal; article; chemistry; environment; food chain; metabolism; mollusc; physiology; tissue distribution; bioaccumulation; mollusc; natural radioactivity; particle radiation; pollution transport; priority journal; radioactive contamination; seashore; sediment; temperature; wind; Animals; Environment; Food Chain; Lead Radioisotopes; Mollusca; Polonium; Sulfur; Tissue Distribution; Environmental engineering; Fluxes; Particles (particulate matter); Radioisotopes; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Hydrothermal vents; Vents; food chain; hydrothermal vent; mollusc; particulate flux; radioactivity; Mediterranean Sea,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,32,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

(2012). Towards a revised Amphinomidae (Annelida, Amphinomida): description and affinities of a new genus and species from the Nile Deep-sea Fan, Mediterranean Sea. Zoologica Scripta, 41, 307-325. The discovery of a new amphinomid species from wood falls deployed near cold seeps (1694 m) at the Nile Deep-sea Fan (Mediterranean Sea) highlights the need to revise Amphinomidae to better characterize amphinomid diversity. The phylogenetic affinities of the new amphinomid and 12 other species from nine Amphinomida genera were inferred using data from two nuclear (18S rDNA and 28S rDNA) and two mitochondrial (COI and 16S rDNA) genes. The phylogenetic analyses indicated a close relationship of the new species with other amphinomids associated with temporary pelagic substrata, including Amphinome sensu stricto (emended herein) and Hipponoa. The new species belongs to a distinct lineage and we, here, erect a new genus to accommodate it. Cryptonome gen. n. is the second amphinomid genus established for species from chemosynthetic environments. Cryptonome conclava sp. n. is distinguished morphologically from all previously described rectilinear Amphinomidae by lacking notochaetal hooks, having a reduced caruncle, modified neurochaetae and branchiae on nearly all segments. Taxonomic issues regarding amphinomid species presently assigned to Amphinome and the erroneous placement of related xylophylic taxa in Eurythoe are also outlined. We emend and restrict the five known oceanic flotsam species with stalked heart-shaped caruncles to Amphinome sensu stricto. An additional 15 species previously assigned to Amphinome may belong to other genera (e. g. Linopherus) and are here tentatively considered incertae sedis. Finally, Eurythoe turcica and Eurythoe parvecarunculata are transferred to Cryptonome gen. n. as new combinations.

A highly diverse suite of microbial membrane lipids was detected. Strongly 13C-depleted lipids diagnostic for archaea include isoprenoid glycerol diethers, isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and several C20-C35 isoprenoid hydrocarbons. Bacterial lipids mainly consist of dialkyl glycerol diethers, branched fatty acids and hopanoids, showing important 13C-depletions, albeit less than archaeal lipids. The data provide further evidence for the involvement of archaea and bacteria in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and in the sequestration of methane-derivedarying distributionortia, expanding on existing work at cold seeps. Distinctive biomarker features - and inferred microbial assemblages - are observed in these crusts, in agreement with available phylogenetic data for the samples. Our results support the potential of lipids for distinguishing methanotrophic communities.

The bacterium was isolated from a natural hot spring ""Ain Echefa"" at Mediteranean sea (Korbous, North-Eastern Tunisia). The novel strain was Gram positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic and grew optimally under conditions of 55°C, 1% (w/v) NaCl and pH 7-8. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain THE22T fell within the radiation of the cluster comprising Paenibacillus species with Paenibacillus phyllosphaerae PALXIL04T as the closest phylogenetic neighbour (95.8%). The predominant components in the fatty methyl ester profile were iso-C16:0 (34.46%), C16:0 (19.64%), anteiso-C15:0 (19.18%) and anteiso-C17:0 (18.11%). The major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7 (MK-7). The diamino acid found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The base composition of DNA was 56 mol%. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic data, strain THE-22T (=DSM 18499T=LMG 23758T) was recognized as a novel species within the genus Paenibacillus.

Cell numbers in samples from different regions around a solitary vent decreased toward the center of the vent (horizontal distribution), as well as with depth (vertical distribution), corresponding to an increase in temperature (from ca. 25 to 60°C) and a decrease in pH (from ca. pH 7 to 5). Thiomicrospira was one of the most abundant culturable sulfur oxidizers and was even dominant in one region. Phylogenetic analysis of Thiomicrospira spp. present in the highest most-probable-number (MPN) dilutions revealed that most of the obtained sequences grouped in two new closely related clusters within the Thiomicrospira branch. Two different new isolates, i.e., Milos-T1 and Milos-T2, were obtained from high-dilution (10-5) enrichments. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that isolate Milos-T1 is related to the recently described Thiomicrospira kuenenii and Hydrogenovibrio marinus, whereas isolate Milos-T2 grouped with the MPN sequences of cluster 2. The predominance of strain Milos-T2 was indicated by its identification in several environmental samples by hybridization analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns and by sequencing of one of the corresponding bands, i.e., ML-1, from the DGGE gel.

In this study, two bivalve species associated with carbonate crusts and reduced sediment are identified based on sequence analysis of their 18S and 28S rRNA-encoding genes, and associated bacterial symbioses are investigated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microscopy-based approaches. The specimens are closely related to Myrtea spinifera and Thyasira flexuosa, two species previously documented at various depths from other regions but not yet reported from the Eastern Mediterranean. Both species harbour abundant gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts in specialized gill epithelial cells. The Myrtea-associated bacterium is closely related to lucinid symbionts from both deep-sea and coastal species, whereas the Thyasira-associated bacterium is closely related to the symbiont of a T. flexuosa from coastal waters off the U.K. An epsilonproteobacterial sequence has also been identified in Thyasira which could correspond to a helicoid-shaped morphotype observed by electron microscopy, but this was not confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Virus-like particles were observed within some symbionts in Thyasira, mostly in bacteriocytes localized close to the ciliated zone of the gill filament. Overall, results indicate that very close relatives of shallow species M. spinifera and T. flexuosa occur at cold seeps in the Eastern Mediterranean and harbour chemoautotrophic symbioses similar to those found in their coastal relatives. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Chemoautotrophy; Cold seeps; Eastern Mediterranean; Myrtea; Symbiosis; Thyasira,bivalve; chemoautotrophy; cold seep; endosymbiont; fauna; interspecific interaction; microbial activity; symbiosis; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Bacteria (microorganisms); Bivalvia; Gorgonacea; Helicoidea; Lucinidae; Myrtea; Myrtea spinifera; Thyasira; Thyasira flexuosa; Thyasiridae,Article,Scopus,Central Zone,32.534722,30.356389,1687,Cold Seeps,Egypt,,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,biological,,macrobenthos,,"Myrtea, Thyasira",survival

Box-core sediments and associated authigenic carbonates have been collected in water depths of 140-170m from two distinctive sectors of the area, and analyzed for major, trace and rare earth elements, stable isotopes, and mineralogy. Relative homogeneity in the mineralogy and geochemistry of bulk sediments, and 210Pb activity distributions, argue against an active mud ejection activity. In the Malta Plateau western sector, the sediments show high concentrations of Fe, As, Sb, and Mo, exceeding the background values estimated for the Strait of Sicily. Active fluid seepage in this area is thought to be responsible for these enrichments and for the formation of authigenic carbonate crusts. Evidence of bacterial involvement in carbonate (mainly aragonite) formation is recorded in the authigenic crusts, which contain flat and spiralled filaments resembling Beggiatoa-like sulphide oxidising bacteria and biofilm-like remains which occur inside the interspaces. Carbonate crusts consistently show extremely negative d13C values (down to -49%) that suggest contribution of carbon originating from anaerobic methane oxidation. Heavy oxygen isotopic compositions of the authigenic carbonates (2-3% higher than those in box-core sediments) are interpreted as due to precipitation from fluids enriched in 18O due to seepage of deep, isotopically-heavy, relict Messinian brines. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Methane oxidation; Sediment geochemistry; Seep carbonate; Stable isotopes; Strait of Sicily,Activity distribution; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Authigenic; Authigenic carbonates; Background value; Central Mediterranean; Core sediments; High concentration; Messinian; Methane oxidation; Mud volcano fields; Mud volcanoes; Oxygen isotopic composition; Seep carbonates; Stable isotopes; Strait of Sicily; Water depth; Anoxic sediments; Bacteriology; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Crystallography; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Lead; Methane; Minerals; Oxidation; Oxygen; Rare earth elements; Seepage; Trace elements; Underwater mineralogy; Volcanoes; Sedimentology; anoxic conditions; carbonate group; isotopic composition; methane; mineralogy; mud volcano; oxidation; rare earth element; sediment chemistry; seepage; stable isotope; trace element; Mediterranean Sea; Strait of Sicily; Bacteria (microorganisms); Beggiatoa,Article,Scopus,Malta Plateau,36.55,14.4667,153,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Sicily Channel,environmental,,,,,

AD. Submarine and subaerial explosive activity lasted for a period of about four months and led to the formation of thick (~ 250 m) highly stratified pumice deposits on the upper crater walls as well as extensive pumice rafts that were dispersed throughout the southern Aegean Sea. Subaerial tephra fallout from eruption columns that breached the surface occurred as far east as Turkey.Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video observations from transects of the northern and southwestern crater walls have been used to create stratigraphic sequences of the 1650AD deposits. Petrographic and geochemical analyses reveal that the bulk of the deposits consists of white, highly vesicular, sparsely porphyritic, biotite-bearing rhyolite pumice. Pre-eruption volatile contents determined from plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions yield a median value of 6.5wt.%. This corresponds to a pre-eruption storage pressure of ~200MPa, or a depth of ~6km assuming a H2O-saturated magma. Comparison of the natural glass compositions and mineral assemblage of the Kolumbo samples with experimental results on other rhyolite magmas of similar composition in the modified haplogranite system supports the pressure and total volatile estimates. Pre-eruption temperature was calculated as 750°C based on plagioclase-melt geothermometry.The high volatile content of the Kolumbo magma and historical accounts of substantial subaerial eruption plumes suggest that the explosive eruption was driven by primary volatile degassing. Three phases of activity can be inferred from historical accounts and deposit stratigraphy; an initial submarine eruption during which time the vent became shallower as pyroclastic material accumulated, a transitional phase with substantial fallout from a hybrid submarine/subaerial eruption plume, and a final subaqueous phase as the eruption waned. Depositional processes included a complex interplay of submarine fallout, pyroclastic density currents, and clast segregation associated with the transition from submarine to subaerial plumes, producing a highly stratified pumiceous sequence. This is the first study of the in situ pyroclastic deposits of a well-documented silicic submarine explosive eruption in the relatively shallow (&lt;. 500. m below sea level) marine environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Degassing; Kolumbo; Pre-eruption conditions; Pyroclastic stratigraphy; Submarine eruption,Depositional process; Geochemical analysis; Historical account; Kolumbo; Pre-eruption conditions; Pyroclastic density currents; Pyroclastic deposits; Stratigraphic sequences; Analytical geochemistry; Degassing; Deposits; Fallout; Feldspar; Granite; Mica; Pulverized fuel; Remotely operated vehicles; Stratigraphy; Volcanoes; Submarines; degassing; explosive volcanism; fallout; petrology; pumice; pyroclastic deposit; stratigraphy; submarine volcano; tephra; volcanic eruption; volcanology; Aegean Sea; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Santorini [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Turkey,Article,Scopus,Kolumbo,36.525,25.4833,495,Volcanic Area,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Here we show high-resolution multibeam, magnetic and gravity surveys of the Marsili seamount, the largest active volcano of Europe located in the southern Tyrrhenian back-arc basin. These surveys reveal zones with exceptionally low densities and with vanishing magnetizations, due probably to the comminution of basalts during hyaloclastic submarine eruptions and to their post-eruptive hydrothermal alteration. The location of these regions correlates with morphological data showing the occurrence of past collapses. Similar evidence has been obtained from pre-existing data at Vavilov Seamount, another older volcanic system in the Tyrrhenian back-arc basin. Here a large volume of at least 50 km3 may have collapsed in a single event from its 40 km long western flank. Given the similarities between these volcanoes, a large collapse event may also be expected at Marsili.

Numerous hydrothermal vents in the crater of Kolumbo submarine volcano (Aegean Sea) are discharging virtually pure gaseous CO2 together with clear fluids at temperatures up to 220 °C. Acoustic imaging of the ascending bubbles suggests that the gas is being dissolved into seawater within ~10 m above the crater floor (500 m below sea level). Dissolution of the gas likely causes local increases in water density that result in sequestration of CO2 within the enclosed crater, and the accumulation of acidic seawater. Lack of macrofauna at the Kolumbo hydrothermal vents, occurrence of carbonate-poor sediment in the crater, and pH values as low as 5.0 in recovered water samples point to acidic conditions within the crater. Buildup of CO2-rich water in the bowl-shaped crater of Kolumbo may be producing conditions analogous to some African volcanic lakes (Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, Cameroon) where overturn of gas-rich bottom waters led to abrupt releases of CO2 at the surface.

We investigated the benthic food web of two deep chemosynthesis-based ecosystems on the Napoli and Amsterdam mud volcanoes (MVs) in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (~2,000 m depth). Seeping methane has been detected at the surface of both MVs during pioneering cruises and has been hypothesised to be assimilated by benthic fauna as observed in other oceans' margins. Given the extreme oligotrophic character of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, we a priori expected that chemosynthetic food sources, especially methane-derived carbon (MDC), played a major trophic role in these deep seep communities relative to what has been observed in other seep systems worldwide. We aimed at unravelling the trophic relationships on Napoli and Amsterdam MVs through the analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopes both in the dominant benthic invertebrates including the small endofauna (300 µm &lt; size &lt; 1 cm) and in the sedimented organic matter. In particular, we assessed the fraction of MDC in the tissue of several heterotrophic and symbiotic species. Low mean d34S and d13C values (0.4 ± 4.8‰ and -31.6 ± 5.7‰, respectively) obtained for mega- and macrofauna suggested that the investigated benthic food webs are virtually exclusively fuelled by carbon of chemosynthetic origin. A few grazer invertebrates (d34S up to 11‰) depart from this trend and could complement their diet with sedimented and decayed phytoplanktonic organic matter. Faunal d13C values indicated that the oxidation of sulphur is likely the predominant energetic pathway for biosynthesis on both MVs. Nevertheless, mytilid bivalves and small capitellid, ampharetid and spionid polychaetes were 13C-depleted (d13C &lt; -37‰) in a way indicating they assimilated a significant portion of MDC. For these later heterotrophic species, MDC ranged between 21 and 31% (lower estimates) and 97 and 100% (upper estimates). However, our results highlighted that the origin of assimilated carbon may be complex for some symbiotic species. The vestimentiferan tubeworm Lamellibrachia sp., which exclusively depends on its sulphur-oxidising endosymbionts, showed a ~20‰ inter-individual d13C variability on a very small spatial scale (&lt;1 m) at the summit of Napoli MV.

The integration of video footage and dissolved CH4 measurements collected 5 days after the event with high-resolution multibeam data collected 4 months later, allowed us to characterize the source area of the outburst, corresponding to a shallow-water mud volcano. The mud volcano covers an area of ca. 170,000 m2, has a vertical relief of ca. 30 m with respect to the surrounding seafloor and an estimated volume of ca. 1 × 106 m3, based on bathymetric reconstruction. The elongated NNW-SSE shape of the mud volcano is compatible with local structural trends, indicating a tectonic control for its development. The mud volcano is made up of two mounds whose tops are located at a depth of ca. 10 m. The southern mound was responsible for the 2017 outburst, as testified by a 15–20 m wide circular crater on its summit where a large amount of mud breccia and diffuse seepage from small pockmarks were observed in video footage . The flanks of the mud volcano are steep and characterized in the upper part by a hummocky morphology and multiple sediment flows on the western flank. The characterization of the mud volcano and the deposits associated with the 2017 gas outburst provides insight into seafloor-shaping processes linked to fluid seepage in shallow-water sectors. This is a particularly relevant issue considering both the paucity of studies on shallow-water mud volcanoes as well as the hazard associated with violent gas outbursts in such settings, as witnessed by the March 16th 2017 event. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Gas outburst; Morphology; Mud volcano; Multibeam; Tuscan Archipelago,Gas bursts; Hydrocarbon seepage; Morphology; Offshore oil well production; Surface waters; Acoustic characterization; CH4-measurements; High resolution; Shallow waters; Shaping process; Structural trends; Tectonic control; Tyrrhenian Sea; Volcanoes; mud volcano; outburst; pockmark; sea surface; seafloor; sediment transport; seepage; shallow water; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tuscan Archipelago; Tuscany; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Scoglio d'Affrica,42.375429,10.076685,12,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Elba Pianosa Ridge,environmental,,,,,

Here, using standard two-channel choice flume, we assessed OA effects on the predator recognition ability of both gabazine-treated and -untreated Symphodus ocellatus post-settlers living off CO2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea. To estimate the post-settlers background predation risk we evaluated the density of their predator in the wild and through otolith aging techniques we assessed their post-settlement growth. Results showed that: 1) post-settlers predator recognition was unaffected under OA; 2) post-settlers living in elevated CO2 were on average 15% bigger in size than those from ambient conditions. Our results support fish behavioural tolerance to OA, potentially mediated by pre-exposure to high-risk predation levels, and speculate that by increasing body size, juvenile fish might more efficiently avoid their predators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon dioxide; CO2 vents; Effects-fish; Global change; pH; Risk assessment; Settlement; Symphodus ocellatus,"Acidification; Carbon dioxide; Fish; pH; Risk perception; Ambient conditions; Brain functions; Global change; Mediterranean sea; Ocean acidifications; Predator recognition; Settlement; Symphodus ocellatus; Risk assessment; 3 amino 2 (3 carboxypropyl) 6 (4 methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; sea water; carbon dioxide; global change; growth rate; juvenile; ocean acidification; pH; predation; risk assessment; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; body growth; body size; carbon dioxide seep; carbon footprint; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental impact; female; fish; juvenile animal; male; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; ocean acidification; population density; predator prey interaction; predator stress; Symphodus ocellatus; water and water related phenomena; animal; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Perciformes; pH; physiological stress; physiology; predation; Mediterranean Sea; Symphodus ocellatus; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mediterranean Sea; Perciformes; Predatory Behavior; Seawater; Stress, Physiological",Article,Scopus,Vulcano,38.4,15,1,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,fish,,"Symphodus ocellatus, Serranus scriba",reproduction

In the present study, the seafloor distribution and recent activity of MVs is investigated across a 35,600 km2 sector of the CAP using a regional acoustic dataset (multibeam bathymetric and backscatter imagery, integrated with subbottom profiles) locally ground-truthed by sediment cores. A total of 54 MVs are identified across water depths of 150-2,750 m using up to four geophysical criteria: distinctive morphology, high backscatter, unstratified subbottom facies and, in one case, a hydroacoustic flare. Fourteen MVs are identified from 3-4 criteria, of which five have been previously proven by cores containing mud breccia beneath up to 1.6 m of hemipelagic sediments (Madonna dello Ionio MVs 1-3, Pythagoras MV and the newly named Sartori MV), while nine others are identified for the first time (Athena, Catanzaro, Cerere, Diana, Giunone, Minerva, 'right foot', Venere 1 and 2). Forty other as yet unnamed MVs are inferred from 1-2 geophysical criteria (three from distinctive morphology alone). All but one possible MV lie on the inner plateau of the CAP, landwards of the Calabrian Escarpment in a zone up to 120 km wide that includes the inner pre-Messinian wedge and the fore-arc basins, where they are interpreted to record the ascent from depth of overpressured fluids that interacted with tectonic structures and with evaporitic or shale seals within the fore-arc basins. The rise of fluids may have been triggered by post-Messinian out-of-sequence tectonism that affected the entire pre-Messinian prism, but Plio-Quaternary sedimentation rates and depositional styles support the inference that significant mud volcanism has taken place only on the inner plateau. Sedimentation rates across the CAP applied to a 12 khz sonar detection depth of 225 cm imply that all MVs with backscatter signatures (50 of 54) have erupted mud breccias within the last 56 ka, and within the last 12.5 ka in the fore-arc basins. Ages of eruption estimated from the depth of cored mud breccias at five MVs, and a seismo-stratigraphic relationship at a sixth, indicate episodes at the last glacial maximum ca. 20 ka BP and during the postglacial period.

The first setting was the Olimpi Mud Volcano field (OMV area), including Napoli, Milano, Maidstone and Moscow mud volcanoes, south of Crete on the Mediterranean ridge. The second setting was the Anaximander Mountains (AM area), southwestern Turkey, where Amsterdam, Kazan and Kula mud volcanoes were explored. Large methane concentrations (45-892 nmol/kg) were measured in the water column not only above mud volcanoes but also in seeps and vents along related fault systems, indicating intense degassing related to fluid circulation in sediments. The tracer results show that there is considerable variability in terms of gas seepage and matter flux between these mud volcanoes. Brine accumulations found as shallow pools on Napoli or associated with deep faults (Nadir Lake) outside mud volcanoes exhibit variable chlorinity, mineral and gas composition. The brines are significantly enriched in d18O relative to ambient seawater and are consistent with evaporated seawater. In the Nadir Brine Lake, the level of methane is as high as 5.93 mmol/kg, lower than the methane saturation level of 120 mmol/kg theoretically found at the salinity (120), pressure (200 bar), and temperature (13.6°C) conditions of Nadir lake. In contrast, the shallow brine pools on Napoli mud volcano (also OMV area) have methane levels of only 4.45 µmol/kg. In all brines, helium data show a clear radiogenic isotopic ratio (R = 0.06 x Ra), in excellent agreement with recently published data for the Urania basin. Methane to ethane ratios (&gt; 1000) and d13C(CH4) values (-65.6‰PDB) indicate that the CH4 is microbially produced. Unlike mid-ocean ridges, where abiogenic methane and helium have a common origin in the brines, the large variation in the CH4/He ratio indicates that CH4 and helium sources are unrelated, a fact that adds further support to the biogenic origin of methane.

Brine accumulations found as shallow pools on Napoli or associated with deep faults (Nadir Lake) outside mud volcanoes exhibit variable chlorinity, mineral and gas composition. The brines are significantly enriched in d18O relative to ambient seawater and are consistent with evaporated seawater. In the Nadir Brine Lake, the level of methane is as high as 5.93 mmol/kg, lower than the methane saturation level of 120 mmol/kg theoretically found at the salinity (120), pressure (200 bar), and temperature (13.6°C) conditions of Nadir lake. In contrast, the shallow brine pools on Napoli mud volcano (also OMV area) have methane levels of only 4.45 µmol/kg. In all brines, helium data show a clear radiogenic isotopic ratio (R = 0.06 x Ra), in excellent agreement with recently published data for the Urania basin. Methane to ethane ratios (&gt; 1000) and d13C(CH4) values (-65.6‰PDB) indicate that the CH4 is microbially produced. Unlike mid-ocean ridges, where abiogenic methane and helium have a common origin in the brines, the large variation in the CH4/He ratio indicates that CH4 and helium sources are unrelated, a fact that adds further support to the biogenic origin of methane. These results show that mud volcanoes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea are important sites of extensive biogenic methane fluxes, which are probably related to widespread occurrences of gas hydrates. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnostic 13C-depleted archaeal lipids of anaerobic methane oxidizers were only found in one core from the South of Çinarcik Basin and consist mainly of archaeol, sn-2 hydroxyarchaeol and various unsaturated pentamethylicosenes. Concurrently, abundant fatty acids (FAs) and a substantial amount of monoalkylglycerolethers (MAGEs), assigned to sulphate-reducing bacteria, were detected with strong 13C-depletions. Both microbial lipids and their d13C values suggest that anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate reduction (AOM/SR) occurs, specially in the 10- to 12-cm depth interval. Lipid biomarker results accompanied by 16S rRNA-based microbial diversity analyses showed that ANME-2 (ANME-2a and -2c) archaea and Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus and Desulfobulbus deltaproteobacterial clades are the major AOM assemblages, which indicate a shallow AOM community at high methane flux. Apart from the typical AOM lipid biomarker pattern, a 13C-depleted diunsaturated hydrocarbon, identified as 7,14-tricosadiene, occurred in the inferred maximum AOM interval at 10-12 cm depth. Its isotopic fingerprint implies that its microbial precursor occurs in close association with the AOM communities. Interestingly, the presence of 7,14-tricosadiene coincides with the presence of the so-far uncultured bacterial Candidate Division JS1, often detected in AOM areas.

Kolumbo’s last eruption was in 1650 AD. However, a unique and active hydrothermal vent field has been revealed in the northern part of its crater floor during an oceanographic survey by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in 2006. In the present study, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data collected by ROV Hercules during three oceanographic surveys onboard E/V Nautilus in 2010 and 2011 have served to investigate the distribution of physicochemical properties in the water column, as well as their behavior directly over the hydrothermal field. Additional CTD measurements were carried out in volcanic cone 3 (VC3) along the same volcanic chain but located 3 km northeast of Kolumbo where no hydrothermal activity has been detected to date. CTD profiles exhibit pronounced anomalies directly above the active vents on Kolumbo’s crater floor. In contrast, VC3 data revealed no such anomalies, essentially resembling open-sea (background) conditions. Steep increases of temperature (e.g., from 16 to 19 °C) and conductivity near the maximum depth (504 m) inside Kolumbo’s cone show marked spatiotemporal correlation. Vertical distributions of CTD signatures suggest a strong connection to Kolumbo’s morphology, with four distinct zones identified (open sea, turbid flow, invariable state, hydrothermal vent field). Additionally, overlaying the near-seafloor temperature measurements on an X–Y coordinate grid generates a detailed 2D distribution of the hydrothermal vent field and clarifies the influence of fluid discharges in its formation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,Floors; Hot springs; Remotely operated vehicles; Submarines; Surveys; Temperature measurement; Conductivity-temperature-depth datum; Hydrothermal activity; Hydrothermal field; Influence of fluid; Oceanographic surveys; Physicochemical property; Spatiotemporal correlation; Vertical distributions; Volcanoes; crater; discharge; hydrothermal vent; open ocean; remotely operated vehicle; seafloor; spatiotemporal analysis; submarine volcano; vertical distribution; volcanic eruption; water column; Aegean Sea; Aegean Sea; Greece; Kolumbo Volcano; Mediterranean Sea; Santorini [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Nautilus,Article,Scopus,Kolumbo,36.525,25.4833,495,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Artificial collectors were placed for 1 month along pH gradients at CO2 vents off Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). Seventy-nine taxa were identified from six main taxonomic groups (foraminiferans, nematodes, polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans and chaetognaths). Calcareous foraminiferans, serpulid polychaetes, gastropods and bivalves showed highly significant reductions in recruitment to the collectors as pCO2 rose from normal (336-341 ppm, pH 8.09-8.15) to high levels (886-5,148 ppm) causing acidified conditions near the vents (pH 7.08-7.79). Only the syllid polychaete Syllis prolifera had higher abundances at the most acidified station, although a wide range of polychaetes and small crustaceans was able to settle and survive under these conditions. A few taxa (Amphiglena mediterranea, Leptochelia dubia, Caprella acanthifera) were particularly abundant at stations acidified by intermediate amounts of CO2 (pH 7. 41-7.99). These results show that increased levels of CO2 can profoundly affect the settlement of a wide range of benthic organisms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",NA,abundance; acidification; benthos; bivalve; carbon dioxide; gastropod; pH; polychaete; settling behavior; survival; Campania [Italy]; Ischia; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Napoli [Campania]; Tyrrhenian Sea; Amphiglena mediterranea; Bivalvia; Caprella acanthifera; Chaetognatha; Crustacea; Foraminifera; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Leptochelia dubia; Mollusca; Nematoda; Polychaeta; Serpulidae; Syllidae; Typosyllis variegata,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,,,survival

Its NW sector (the Adventure Plateau), where water depths rarely exceed 100 m, is punctuated by several kilometre-sized morphological highs. These elevations, formed by both sedimentary and volcanic rocks, emerged around middle Holocene time or earlier when they constituted a large archipelago. High-resolution single-channel and multichannel seismic reflection profiles, along with stratigraphic and lithological information derived from exploration wells and rock samplings, are analysed to derive the shallow and deep structural setting of these banks and identify their geological nature. The sedimentary banks (Talbot, Ante-Talbot, Panope, Nereo and Pantelleria Vecchia), presently located at water depths 8-40 m, are composed of Miocene rocks severely deformed by a late Miocene compressional phase which produced the external sector of the Sicilian-Maghrebian thrust belt. Tortonian-aged rock samples from the Pantelleria Vecchia Bank represent patch reefs that have mostly formed on structural highs. Sedimentary analogies suggest that other sedimentary banks of the Adventure Plateau may have the same origin. Galatea, Anfitrite and Tetide represent submarine volcanic edifices emplaced on major extensional faults formed during early Pliocene - Quaternary continental rifting of the Sicilian Channel. The present-day morphology of the banks is the result of repeated phases of subaerial exposure and drowning, especially since the Last Glacial Maximum.

The detailed magnetic chronology shows that from the late Matuyama (1.77 Ma), the average half spreading rate was about 1.5 cm yr-1, with a slight decrease between the Jaramillo and the Brunhes events, when the growth of the volcanic edifice overcame lateral spreading. Analysis of spreading rate and volume of erupted lava indicates that at the beginning of the Jaramillo subchron (1.07 Ma), the Marsili basin evolved from pure horizontal spreading to a superinflated seamount as a consequence of tearing of the Ionian slab.

Examination of the sonar imagery revealed numerous acoustic targets, each on the order of a few meters and surrounded by small depressions. Subsequent visual inspection of two of these targets by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) revealed they were cold hydrocarbon seeps through which small bubbles of gas and shimmering fluids were emitted. Surrounding each cold seep were benthic communities of organisms. The ROV was used to gather video and still-camera imagery, map the surrounding microbathymetry, and collect samples of the seep structure and associated organisms. A sub-bottom profiler, which was attached to the ROV, was used to image the submerged structure of the second seep site. Further examination and analysis revealed that the seeps comprise hard deposits of calcium carbonate, and that the organisms are clams and polychaetes which are probably chemosymbiotic. The origin of the seep gas is hypothesized to be the natural decay of organic matter in the sapropel sediment, leading to the production of methane. Circulating fluids, which carry the dissolved gas through preferential pathways along small faults or bedding planes, percolate through the seafloor, precipitate calcium carbonate, release gas, and support the benthic organisms.",NA,cold seep; gas seepage; hydrocarbon; methane; organic matter; sapropel; Mediterranean Sea,Article,Scopus,no-name,31.65,33.45,550,Cold Seeps,Egypt,methane,Eastern Mediterranean,environmental,,,,,

The occurrence of benthic fauna impacted by debris was rarely recorded (only 10.6% of litter items showed interactions with species) and entanglement was the most commonly observed impact.

It is considered part of an alignment of volcanic edifices developed in the central-eastern Tyrrhenian Sea, from the western Pontine Islands (WPI) to the Campanian Volcanic Region. The samples dredged along the VR are basalts to trachybasalts belonging to the transitional (TR) rock-series, with a 40Ar-39Ar age of 2.760 ± 0.039 Ma. Petrological and geochronological data link the VR basalts to the TR peralkaline rhyolites cropping out at the WPI (~1.6-1.1 Ma); here, during a time span of ~4.5-1.0 Ma highly differentiated products of high-potassium calc-alkaline (HKCA, ~4.5-2.9 Ma) and K-alkaline (KA, ~1 Ma) series were also erupted. Notably, the parental melts of the three rock-series were recognized in the continental slope close to the WPI (TR, HKCA) and eastward, namely in eastern Pontine Islands (KA), at the VR (TR), and in the Campanian Plain (HKCA). All the parental melts show typical orogenic geochemical signatures being originated from a similar heterogeneous suprasubduction mantle source, without the involvement of anorogenic sources. Tectonically, the faults bordering the VR, associated to the Pliocene E-W directed rifting stage of the Tyrrhenian back-arc basin were characterized by a more intense activity during the time span ~5.0-2.0 Ma (the emplacement time of HKCA and TR series), while KA products are related to a later stage of extension deformation (&lt;~2.0 Ma) when the extensional direction changed to NW-SE and the VR fault activity decreased. © 2020.

This area is seismically active with instrumentally and/or historically recorded Mw > 7:0 earthquakes, and it is affected by recently discovered long strike-slip faults across the active Calabrian accretionary wedge. Many mud volcanoes occur on top of the wedge. A recently discovered one (called the Bortoluzzi Mud Volcano or BMV) was surveyed during the Seismofaults 2017 cruise (May 2017). High-resolution bathymetric backscatter surveys, seismic reflection profiles, geochemical and earthquake data, and a gravity core are used here to geologically, geochemically, and geophysically characterize this structure. The BMV is a circular feature ' 22 m high and ' 1100 m in diameter with steep slopes (up to a dip of 22). It sits atop the Calabrian accretionary wedge and a system of flower-like oblique-slip faults that are probably seismically active as demonstrated by earthquake hypocentral and focal data. Geochemistry of water samples from the seawater column on top of the BMV shows a significant contamination of the bottom waters from saline (evaporite-type) CH4-dominated crustal-derived fluids similar to the fluids collected from a mud volcano located on the Calabria mainland over the same accretionary wedge. These results attest to the occurrence of open crustal pathways for fluids through the BMV down to at least the Messinian evaporites at about-3000 m. This evidence is also substantiated by helium isotope ratios and by comparison and contrast with different geochemical data from three seawater columns located over other active faults in the Ionian Sea area. One conclusion is that the BMV may be useful for tracking the seismic cycle of active faults through geochemical monitoring. Due to the widespread diffusion of mud volcanoes in seismically active settings, this study contributes to indicating a future path for the use of mud volcanoes in the monitoring and mitigation of natural hazards. © 2019 Author(s).",NA,Diffusion in liquids; Earthquakes; Geochemical surveys; Geochemistry; Hydrographic surveys; Seawater; Strike-slip faults; Volcanoes; Accretionary wedge; Earthquake data; Geochemical data; Geochemical monitoring; Helium isotopes; High resolution; Seismic reflection profiles; Southern Italy; Fault slips; accretionary prism; active fault; bathymetric survey; earthquake; geochemistry; gravity field; mud volcano; seismic reflection; seismicity; tracking; Ionian Sea; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Brome mosaic virus,Article,Scopus,Bortoluzzi,37.883611,16.280556,1400,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Calabrian Arc,environmental,,,,,

High-resolution multibeam bathymetry, combined with magnetic data, multi- and single-channel seismic profiles, and ROV dives, suggest that VR results from aggregation of a series of volcanic edifices. The summit of these volcanoes is flat and occurs at about 170 m water depth. Given their depths, we propose that flat morphologies were probably caused by surf erosion during Quaternary glacial sea level lowstands. Seismic stratigraphy together with magnetic data suggest that the volcanic activity in this area is older than 190–130 ka age and may be coeval with that of Ventotene Island (Middle Pleistocene). The submarine volcanoes, located 25 km north of Ventotene, are part of a ~E-W regional volcanic alignment and extend the Pontine volcanism landward toward the Gaeta bay. Integration of structural data from multichannel seismic profiles in this sector of the eastern Tyrrhenian margin indicates that several normal and/or transtensional faults, striking WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, and NE-SW, offset the basement and form alternating structural highs and depressions filled by thick, mostly undeformed, sedimentary units. Arc-related magmatism is widespread in the study area, where the VR is placed at the hangingwall of the west-directed Apennines subduction zone, which is undergoing tensional and transtensional tectonics. Bathymetric and topographic evidence shows that VR lies in between a major NE-SW trending escarpment east of Ponza and a NE-SW trending graben southwest of the Roccamonfina volcano, a NE-SW transfer zone that accommodate the extension along this segmented portion of the margin. This suggests that the interaction between NE-SW and NW-SE trending fault systems acts as a structural control on location of eruptive centers, given that main volcanic edifices develop along the NW-SE direction, compatible with the extensional setting of the Tyrrhenian basin. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",High-resolution geophysical data; Pontine Islands; Submarine volcanic edifices,backarc basin; bathymetry; geomorphology; seismic stratigraphy; submarine volcano; topography; volcanism; Italy; Latina; Lazio; Mediterranean Sea; Pontine Islands; Tyrrhenian Sea; Ventotene,Article,Scopus,Ventotene,40.799199,13.432374,100,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Ventotene Ridge,environmental,,,,,

Two collapse events have been recovered in the record: a) the Ischia submarine debris avalanche/debris flow (DA/DF), dated between ~3kaB.P. and 2.4kaB.P. and possibly between 2.7kaB.P. and 2.4kaB.P. (event DF1); b) a former, pre-Holocene, DA/DF older than 23calkaB.P. (event DF2). The Ischia DA, with an estimated volume of 1.5km3, incorporates thousands of blocks that are still detectable on the sea-floor until 45-50km far from the island. Our results indicate an age of emplacement younger than previously thought and support the hypothesis that a major catastrophic event occurred when the island was already inhabited by Greek settlers (i.e. after the 7th century BC). Three ash layers have been recognised in the post-DF1 avalanche sequence and correlated with Ischian eruptions occurred between Middle Ages and Roman times. Two tephras recovered in the pre-DF1 succession have been correlated with explosive activity occurred on Ischia and Procida islands from ~23ka to ~17.5kaB.P. The results presented here improve the chronostratigraphic reconstruction of the main eruptive and collapse events that affected Ischia volcano during Late Pleistocene-Holocene and their dispersal at sea.

This is also true for unique and scattered deep-sea habitats such as cold seeps. Given the limited dispersal capacity of marine nematodes, genetic differentiation between such geographically isolated habitat patches is expected to be high. Against this background, we examined genetic variation in both mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (18S and 28S ribosomal) DNA markers of 333 individuals of the genus Sabatieria, abundantly present in reduced cold-seep sediments. Samples originated from four Eastern Mediterranean cold seeps, separated by hundreds of kilometers, and one seep in the Southeast Atlantic.

The number of private haplotypes was high (15), but the number of mutations between haplotypes was low (1-8). These results indicate intermediary gene flow among the Mediterranean Sabatieria populations with no evidence of long-term barriers to gene flow.

The hydrothermal system is active at present and discharges magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and precipitates massive sulfides. The sulfides exhibit multi-stage deposition, evident in the alternation of several mineral generations that follow a general temporal precipitation sequence: marcasite <U+2192> alunite <U+2192> opal. Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data indicate that most of the metals in the sulfides are derived predominantly from the Panarea volcanic rocks with some contribution from ambient seawater and/or local sediments. A remarkable feature of these sulfides is their chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REEN) distribution pattern with a pronounced negative Eu anomaly, which has not been observed previously. Our study demonstrates that this REEN pattern reflects the REE fractionation during sulfide deposition. The ionic radius mismatch between Eu2+ (the main form of Eu in reduced, high-temperature hydrothermal fluids) and the only possible site for REE substitution in the marcasite, that of Fe2+, suggests a crystallographic control on the REEN pattern. Apparently, marcasite precipitation can generate a sulfide deposit with a negative Eu anomaly due to discrimination against Eu2+ relative to REE3+ in the Fe2+ crystallographic site. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",Eu anomaly; Hydrothermal; Massive sulfide; Rare earth elements; Tyrrhenian Sea,Eu anomalies; Geochemical investigations; Hydrothermal; Massive sulfides; Precipitation sequence; Seafloor hydrothermal systems; Seafloor massive sulfides; Tyrrhenian Sea; Deposition; Isotopes; Lasers; Lead; Neodymium; Rare earth elements; Seawater; Strontium; Volcanic rocks; Sulfide minerals; geochemistry; hydrothermal system; massive sulfide; mineralogy; rare earth element; seafloor; Aeolian Arc; Italy; Lipari Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Panarea; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.6583,15.1,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The Marsili ochres belong to type 1 primary sulfide-poor Fe-oxyhydroxides according to the classification of Hekinian et al. [Hekinian, R., Hoffert, M., Larqué, P., Cheminée, J.L., Stoffers, P., Bideau, D., 1993. Hydrothermal Fe and Si oxyhydroxide deposits from south Pacific intraplate volcanoes and East Pacific Rise axial and off-axial regions. Econ. Geol. 88, 2099-2121]. They are X-ray amorphous, highly metalliferous [Al/(Al + Mn + Fe) « 0.4], low in Si, transition metals (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb) and rare earth elements (REE) and enriched in B, V and Mo. Their chemical composition and REE distribution patterns indicate precipitation from low-temperature hydrothermal fluid mixed with seawater. Measured Pb isotope compositions in the ochres indicate that the Pb is dominantly anthropogenic in origin. By contrast, the Pb isotope ratios in the nearby higher temperature hydrothermal deposits from the Panarea arc volcano show that the Pb is derived mainly from local volcanic rocks. The fact that the Pb isotopic signature of the Marsili ochres is controlled by recent anthropogenic input suggests that the Fe-oxyhydroxides precipitated from fluids depleted in transition metals. The low 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the ochres reflect the contribution of Pb from Australian ores, indicating precipitation of the ochres somewhere between present-day and the beginning of Australian Pb import to Europe. The young age of the ochres and the presence of other hydrothermal deposits along the Marsili crest suggest that the magmatic chamber beneath the seamount may still be alive.

Sequential leaching experiments reveal that most of the elements considered to have a hydrothermal or hydrogenous origin in a marine environment, such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, are present mainly in the aluminosilicate fraction of the dolomitic claystones. Their vertical distribution, content and partitioning chemistry of trace elements, and REE patterns suggest enhanced terrigenous input during dolomite formation, but no significant hydrothermal influence from the underlying basaltic basement. Positive correlations in the C and O isotopes in the dolomites reflect complex conditions during the dolomitization. The stable isotopes can be controlled in part by temperature variations during the dolomitization. Majority of the samples, however, form a trend that is steeper than expected for only temperature control on the C and O isotopes. The latter indicates possible isotopic heterogeneity in the proto-carbonate that can be related to arid climatic conditions during the formation of the basal dolomitic claystones. In addition, the dolostones stable isotopic characteristics can be influenced by diagenetic release of heavier d18O from clay dehydration and/or alteration of siliciclastic material. Strontium and Pb isotopic data reveal that the non-carbonate fraction, the ""dye"" of the dolomitic claystones, is controlled by Saharan dust (75%-80%) and by material with isotopic characteristics similar to the Aeolian Arc volcanoes (20%-25%). The non-carbonate fraction of the calcareous ooze overlying the dolomitic claystones has a Sr and Pb isotopic composition identical to that of the dolomitic claystones, indicating that no change in the input sources to the sedimentary basin occurred during and after the dolomitization event. Combination of climato-tectonic factors most probably resulted in suitable conditions for dolomitization in the Marsili and the nearby Vavilov Basins. The basal dolomitic claystone sequence was formed at the initiation of the opening of the Marsili Basin (~ 2 Ma), which coincided with the consecutive glacial stage. The glaciation caused arid climate and enhanced evaporation that possibly contributed to the stable isotope variations in the proto-carbonate. The conductive cooling of the young lithosphere produced high heat flow in the region, causing low-temperature passive convection of pore waters in the basal calcareous sediment. We suggest that this pumping process was the major dolomitization mechanism since it is capable of driving large volumes of seawater (the source of Mg2+) through the sediment. The red-brown hue of the dolomitic claystones is terrigenous contribution of the glacially induced high eolian influx and was not hydrothermally derived from the underlying basaltic basement. The detailed geochemical investigation of the basal dolomitic sequence indicates that the dolomitization was most probably related to complex tectono-climatic conditions set by the initial opening stages of the Marsili Basin and glaciation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The red-brown layers are Fe-rich metalliferous sediments formed as a result of low-temperature (~ 77 °C) hydrothermal discharge, whereas the bluish-grey layers most probably originated from background sedimentation of Al-rich detrital material. The metalliferous layers are composed mainly of Si-rich goethite containing some Al. Co-precipitation of hydrothermally released SiO44- and Fe2+ as amorphous or poorly crystalline Fe-Si-oxyhydroxides explains the high Si concentration in goethite. The elevated Al content of the goethite is fairly unusual, but reflects the extremely high background Al content of the Tyrrhenian seawater due to the high eolian terrigenous flux from the Sahara desert. The Sr and Nd isotope data suggest that the Eolo metalliferous sediments are the product of a 3-component mixture: hydrothermal fluid, seawater, and detrital material (Saharan dust and Aeolian Arc material). The enrichment in Fe, P, As, Mo, Cd, Be, Sb, W, Y, V, depletion in REE and transition elements (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn) and the REE distribution patterns support the low-temperature hydrothermal deposition of the metalliferous layers. The hydrothermal field is located in a seawater layer of relative O2 depletion, which led to a significant fractionation of the hydrothermally emitted Fe and Mn. Fe-oxyhydroxides precipitated immediately around the vents whereas Mn stayed in solution longer and the Mn-oxides precipitated higher up on the seamount slope in seawater with relatively higher O2 levels. High seismic activity led to sediment re-deposition and slumping of the Mn-rich layers down slope and mixing with the Fe-rich layers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The clay bed is composed of pure nontronite (described for the first time in the Tyrrhenian Sea), which appears to be the most aluminous nontronite ever found among the seafloor hydrothermal deposits. The high Al content suggests precipitation from Al-containing hydrothermal solutions. The REE distribution of the Eolo nontronite has a V-shape pattern. The heavy REE enrichment is in part due to their preferential partitioning in the nontronite structure. This enrichment was possibly further enhanced by the HREE preferential sorption on bacterial cell walls. The light REE enrichment is the result of scavenging uptake by one of the nontronite precursors, i.e., poorly-ordered Fe-oxyhydroxides, from the hydrothermal fluids. Oxygen isotopic composition of the nontronite yields a formation temperature of 30 °C, consistent with a low-temperature hydrothermal origin. The relatively radiogenic Nd isotopic signature of the nontronite compared to the present-day Mediterranean seawater indicates that approximately half of Nd, and presumably the rest of the LREE, are derived from local volcanic sources. On the other hand, 87Sr/86Sr is dominated by present-day seawater Sr. Scanning electron microscopy investigation revealed that the nontronite is composed of aggregates of lepispheres and tube-like filaments, which are indicative of bacteria assisted precipitation. Bacteria inhabiting this hydrothermal site likely acted as reactive geochemical surfaces on which poorly-ordered hydrothermal Fe-oxyhydroxides and silica precipitated. Upon aging, the interactions of these primary hydrothermal precipitates coating bacterial filaments and cell walls likely led to the formation of nontronite. Finally, the well-balanced interlayer and layer charges of the crystal lattice of seafloor hydrothermal nontronite decrease its sorption capacity to zero. Thus the ubiquitous nontronite precipitation along the active plate boundaries and around the hot spots has no significant impact on oceanic trace element chemistry. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, protein tissue content and morphometric characteristics were performed on transplanted individuals (short-term exposure) as well as on specimens resident to both normal and low pH/high pCO2 environments (long-term exposure). Results obtained on transplanted worms showed no significant differences in CA activity between individuals exposed to control and acidified conditions, while a decrease in weight was observed under short-term acclimatization to both control and low pH, although at low pH the decrease was more pronounced (~20%). As regard individuals living under chronic exposure to high pCO2, the morphometric results revealed a significantly lower (70%) wet weight of specimens from the vents with respect to animals living in high pH/low pCO2 areas. Moreover, individuals living in the Castello vents showed doubled values of enzymatic activity and a significantly higher (50%) protein tissue content compared to specimens native from normal pH/low pCO2. The results of this study demonstrated that B. boholense is inclined to maintain a great homeostatic capacity when exposed to low pH, although likely at the energetic expense of other physiological processes such as growth, especially under chronic exposure to high pCO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Acclimatization; Biomarker; Carbonic anhydrase; High pCO2; Mediterranean sea; Non-indigenous species; pH; Physiological trade-offs; Polychaete; Transplant experiment,Biomarkers; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; pH; Physiology; Tissue; Vents; Acclimatization; High pCO2; Mediterranean sea; Nonindigenous species; Polychaete; Trade off; Carbonic anhydrase; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; sea water; acclimation; biomarker; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; growth response; hydrothermal vent; invasive species; morphometry; ocean acidification; physiological response; polychaete; protein; acclimatization; animal tissue; body weight loss; Branchiomma boholense; case study; controlled study; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; Italy; long term exposure; morphometry; nonhuman; ocean acidification; pH; Polychaeta; protein content; sea pollution; animal; annelid; chemistry; enzymology; hydrothermal vent; introduced species; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; physiology; Campania [Italy]; Ischia; Italy; Napoli [Campania]; Animalia; Annelida; Branchiomma; Polychaeta; Sabellidae; Acclimatization; Animals; Annelida; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrothermal Vents; Introduced Species; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Seawater,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,Polychaeta,Branchiomma boholense,survival

In particular a possible spread of the venting activity in the northern and southern sectors of the study area, towards the edge of the Zannone insular shelf, is inferred. The impact of fluid emissions on foraminiferal assemblages can be summarized in the following observations: reduced biodiversity, increase of agglutinated species with predominant siliceous component in the test structure, limited distribution of living specimens inside the sediment, disappearance of porcelaneous taxa and presence of carbonate loss tests. As the result, the venting activity is likely to be the main environmental driver on the meiofaunal distribution.

Outside the pockmark in the nearby area of ZGP, the integrated meiofaunal and geochemical data suggest a transitional condition between vent influenced sedimentation and the typical carbonate sedimentation recorded in the rest of the Pontine Archipelago. In particular a possible spread of the venting activity in the northern and southern sectors of the study area, towards the edge of the Zannone insular shelf, is inferred. The impact of fluid emissions on foraminiferal assemblages can be summarized in the following observations: reduced biodiversity, increase of agglutinated species with predominant siliceous component in the test structure, limited distribution of living specimens inside the sediment, disappearance of porcelaneous taxa and presence of carbonate loss tests. As the result, the venting activity is likely to be the main environmental driver on the meiofaunal distribution. We also report, at the emission sites in the Pontine Archipelago, the presence of agglutinated species such as Spiculosiphon oceana, Jaculella acuta, Deuterammina rotaliformis, never found earlier in the Mediterranean Sea. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Benthic foraminiferal assemblages; central Mediterranean Sea; CO2 emissions; Giant depression; Pontine Archipelago; Seafloor venting,Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Central Mediterranean; Foraminiferal assemblages; Giant depression; Pontine Archipelago; Seafloor venting; Carbonation; benthic environment; benthic foraminifera; benthos; carbon emission; community structure; dissolution; Great Depression; hydrothermal activity; hydrothermal system; hydrothermal vent; meiofauna; micropaleontology; new record; pockmark; seafloor; venting; Italy; Latina; Lazio; Mediterranean Sea; Pontine Islands; Tyrrhenian Sea; Jaculella acuta,Article,Scopus,Zannone,40.972222,13.103056,150,Pockmarks,Italy,,Pontine Archipelago,environmental,,,,,

The core was taken in order to decipher the sedimentary record of the past volcanic events of the nearby Aeolian arc. A succession of thin (2 cm to 5 cm thick) fine-grained turbidites, mainly of volcaniclastic origin, topped by hemipelagic mud layers and a number of primary tephra layers were recovered by the core. The most prominent turbidite occurs in the lower part of the core at 385 cm. It consists of a 20 cm-thick, thinning-upward, pebble to sand-sized bed. Grain-size analysis and component compositions in the 0.063-0.250 mm size fractions were determined on thirty samples taken from primary tephra beds and the silty-sandy basal part of the volcaniclastic turbidite units. SEM scans and glass fraction chemical analyses were successively carried out on a selection of 17 samples. To aid source correlation and comparison, sub-aerial tephras of the Lower Pollara (Salina, 24 ± 3.6 ka), Gabellotto-Fiumebianco (Lipari, 8.5 or 11.5 ka), Monte Pilato (Lipari, 749 or 580 AD) and Secche di Lazzaro (Stromboli, ~ 5 ka) eruptions were also analyzed with the same procedure. Primary tephra respectively belonging to the eruptions of Lower Pollara, Gabellotto-Fiumebianco and Vesuvius (AP eruptions 3.5 ka-79 AD) were identified in the core at the expected relative stratigraphic depths. Two turbidite beds composed of monogenic glass shards were also identified and interpreted as the remobilisation of primary tephras of Secche di Lazzaro (Stromboli, 5 ka) and Pilato (Lipari, 580 or 749 AD). Tephrochronology results indicate that the cored sequence formed in the last 30 ka suggesting an average sedimentation rate of 0.15-0.17 mm/y. The thick pebbly sandy turbidite unit in the lower part of the core has component and glass composition compatible with the Lower Pollara volcanic sequence of Salina Island. In view of the grain-size and thickness of the turbidite unit, we suggest that it represents the deposit of a large failure event. The tephra corresponding to the Lower Pollara event lies below the turbidite unit, separated by 16 cm of hemipelagic mud, indicating that the collapse took place sometime after the eruption. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments were conducted in shallow Posidonia stands (2-3 m depth), in three stations on the north and three on the south sides of the study area, distributed along a pH gradient. At each station, 4 rhizome mimics and 6 artificial leaves were collected every three months (Sept 2009-Sept 2010). The epibionts on both leaf and rhizome mimics showed clear changes along the pH gradient; coralline algae and calcareous invertebrates (bryozoans, serpulid polychaetes and barnacles) were dominant at control stations but progressively disappeared at the most acidified stations. In these extremely low pH sites the assemblage was dominated by filamentous algae and non calcareous taxa such as hydroids and tunicates.

The dominant intracellular symbiont of Lamellibrachia sp. is a gammaproteobacterium closely related to other sulfide-oxidizing tubeworm symbionts. In vivo uptake experiments show that the tubeworm relies on sulfide for its metabolism, and does not utilize methane.

We investigated the effects of ocean acidification on shell composition and structure in four ecologically important species of Mediterranean gastropods (two limpets, a top-shell snail, and a whelk). Individuals were sampled from three sites near a volcanic CO2 seep off Vulcano Island, Italy. The three sites represented ambient (8.15 pH), moderate (8.03 pH) and low (7.73 pH) seawater mean pH. Shell mineralogy, microstructure, and mechanical strength were examined in all four species. We found that the calcite/aragonite ratio could vary and increased significantly with reduced pH in shells of one of the two limpet species. Moreover, each of the four gastropods displayed reductions in either inner shell toughness or elasticity at the Low pH site.

One of these areas is located east of Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands - Southern Tyrrhenian Sea - Italy). Here, the volcanic activity that characterizes the Aeolian archipelago causes a continuous release of CO2 (up to 98% of the total gas) from several vents on the seafloor in shallow water. This area was studied by means of surface techniques and direct SCUBA diving surveys; the data presented refers to a field campaign performed in 2008. To collect the necessary data, some dedicated sampling and measuring techniques were developed for use in an underwater environment. The chemistry of the fluids and their influence on the water body was determined via logs and transects in the field and by gas-chromatographic and liquid-chromatographic laboratory analysis. The flux from some of the main gas vents was also measured directly underwater. Furthermore, some laboratory experiments in a two-layer stratified fluid were conducted to understand the main features of the physical interaction of a gas plume with the surrounding environment. Both field and laboratory experiments show that there is a development of a pseudo-convective cell around the rising plume with the formation of vortices that act as a physical barrier thus reducing the interaction between the plume and the surrounding water. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigate the acclimation potential of stony corals living along a pH gradient caused by a Mediterranean CO2 vent that serves as a natural long-term experimental setting. We show that in response to reduced skeletal mineralization at lower pH, corals increase their skeletal macroporosity (features >10 µm) in order to maintain constant linear extension rate, an important criterion for reproductive output. At the nanoscale, the coral skeleton's structural features are not altered. However, higher skeletal porosity, and reduced bulk density and stiffness may contribute to reduce population density and increase damage susceptibility under low pH conditions. Based on these observations, the almost universally employed measure of coral biomineralization, the rate of linear extension, might not be a reliable metric for assessing coral health and resilience in a warming and acidifying ocean. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",NA,"calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; sea water; acclimation; acidification; biomineralization; coral reef; macropore; marine sediment; pH; population decline; skeletal remains; acclimatization; acidification; alkalinity; Article; atomic force microscopy; biomineralization; bulk density; coral; Mediterranean Sea; micro-computed tomography; nuclear magnetic resonance; pH; population density; porosity; rigidity; scanning electron microscopy; X ray crystallography; animal; Anthozoa; bone mineralization; chemistry; coral reef; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; porosity; sea; Anthozoa; Scleractinia; Acclimatization; Animals; Anthozoa; Calcification, Physiologic; Carbon Dioxide; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mediterranean Sea; Oceans and Seas; Porosity; Seawater",Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.6583,15.1,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,macrobenthos,Anthozoa,Balanophyllia europaea,calcification

Detailed geothermal and geochemical investigations of Isis MV have been carried out during the NAUTINIL (2003) and MIMES (2004) cruises within the framework of the Euro-margins/Mediflux project. Sediment temperatures of more than 40 °C at 10 m below the seafloor at the center of the mud volcano indicate an exceptionally high level of activity. Rapidly decreasing temperature gradients away from the center support the hypothesis of a dominantly axisymmetric functioning of Isis MV. The microbathymetry along dive tracks of the submersible Nautile reveals the presence of terraces and shows that the temperature gradients at shallow sediment depth follow the morphology. At the center, porewater profiles are characterized by a rapid decrease of chlorinity within the uppermost meter of the sediments, whereas the chlorinity of cores taken at short distances away is equal to bottom water values. Applying simple analytical models to the data provides evidence of recent mud volcano activity but no straightforward explanation of the observed anomalies, which points to a transient regime of variable fluid flow, possibly accompanied by episodic mud eruptions. Numerical modeling suggests that rapid cooling of the sediment column and downward progression of the sharp decrease in porewater chlorinity observed between the two cruises is related to episodic infiltration of bottom seawater into the mud. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The volcanic rocks comprise widespread dacite domes and andesite lava flows from several small volcanic centers and are only imprecisely dated. In this paper, the integrated analysis of swath bathymetry, side scan sonar data, and high resolution seismic reflection profiles correlated with core samples, has allowed detailed mapping, characterization and precise chronological identification of the Pausanias submarine volcanic field activity offshore northern Methana. Six volcanic cones or domes are recognized, typically 1–3 km in diameter, some elongated NE–SW and some with a small central crater. On their flanks, the acoustically reflective volcanic rocks pass laterally into incoherent transparent seismic facies interpreted as volcaniclastic deposits, possibly including hyaloclastites, that interfinger with the regional basin sediments. A sea-bottom hummocky field, is interpreted as volcanic avalanche and appears to be the submarine continuation of the volcaniclastic apron of northern Methana peninsula. A robust chronostratigraphic framework has been established, based on the recognition of shoreline progradational units and their connection with Quaternary eustatic sea level cycles. Relative dating of the different phases of submarine volcanic activity during the Upper Quaternary has been achieved by correlating the imaged volcaniclastic flows, interlayered within the chronostratigraphically dated sediments. Dating by stratigraphic position, relative to 2D imaged eustatic sea level clinoform wedges appears to be more precise than radiometric methods on land. Three main submarine Volcanic Events (VE) are recognized: VE3 at ~450 ka, a less precisely dated interval at 200–130 ka (VE2), and VE1 at ~14 ka. Based on chronostratigraphic constraints, subsidence rates of 0.16 (±0.008) m/ka in-between Marine Isotopic Stages 6 and 12 and 0.19 (±0.009) m/ka in-between Marine Isotopic Stages 12 and 16 were estimated for the marine basin north of Methana. The morphological similarity to the onshore volcanoes of Methana Peninsula implies that magmatic constructive processes were dominant, regardless of whether in air or in water. The Upper Quaternary submarine volcanic rocks of Methana differ from those known from stratovolcanoes elsewhere in the Mediterranean, (e.g. Kos-Nisyros, Stromboli) and in other volcanic arcs (e.g., Montserrat, St Vincent), in the submarine development of domes or small cones, the paucity of volcano flank failure deposits and the lack of explosive events. Pausanias volcanic products date the onset of NE–SW faulting as well as the following tectonic phase of E-W striking faults, possibly related to basin inversion, caused by a major rifting phase that also affected most of the South Aegean Arc and the adjacent Gulfs of Corinth and Argolikos. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Eastern Mediterranean; Rifting phase; Seismic stratigraphy; Submarine volcanoes; Tectonics,Deposits; Domes; Faulting; Isotopes; Ocean structures; Sea level; Seismology; Stratigraphy; Submarines; Tectonics; Underwater acoustics; Volcanoes; Constructive process; Eastern Mediterranean; High resolution seismic; Integrated analysis; Marine isotopic stages; Rifting phase; Seismic stratigraphy; Volcaniclastic deposits; Volcanic rocks; dacite; dome; lava flow; Pliocene; rifting; sea level change; seismic stratigraphy; stratovolcano; strike-slip fault; submarine volcano; tectonic setting; volcanic arc; volcaniclastic deposit; Attica; Greece; Gulf of Corinth; Ionian Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Methana,Article,Scopus,Methana,37.63333,23.366667,6,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,CO2,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Here, the changing composition of the seeping fluids and the dynamic nature of the seepage induced the precipitation of pyrite, siderite and other carbonate phases. The occurrence of this array of authigenic precipitates is thought to be related to fluctuation of the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Concretions of authigenic minerals formed in the near sub-bottom sediments of the Paola Ridge were investigated for their geochemical and isotopic composition. These concretions were collected in an area characterized by the presence of two alleged mud volcanoes and three mud diapirs. The mud diapirs are dotted by pockmarks and dissected by normal faults, and are known for having been a site of fluid seepage for at least the past 40 kyrs. Present-day venting activity occurs alongside the two alleged mud volcanoes and is dominated by CO2-rich discharging fluids. This discover led us to question the hypothesis of the mud volcanoes and investigate the origin of the fluids in each different domed structure of the study area. In this study, we used stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen) of carbonates coupled with rare earth element (REE) composition of different carbonate and non-carbonate phases for tracing fluid composition and early diagenesis of authigenic precipitates. The analyses on authigenic precipitates were coupled with chemical investigation of venting gas and sea-water. Authigenic calcite/aragonite concretions, from surficial sediments on diapiric structures, have depleted 13C isotopic composition and slightly positive d18O values. By contrast, siderite concretions, generally found within the first 6 m of sediments on the alleged mud volcanoes, yielded positive d13C and d18O values. The siderite REE pattern shows consistent LREE (light REE) fractionation, MREE (medium REE) enrichment and positive Gd and La anomalies. As shown by the REE distribution, the 13C-depleted composition and their association with chemosymbiotic fauna, calcite/aragonite precipitated at time of moderate to high methane flux close to the seafloor, under the influence of bottom seawater. Authigenic siderite, on the other hand, formed in the subseafloor, during periods of lower gas discharges under prolonged anoxic conditions within sediments in equilibrium with 13C-rich dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 18O-rich water, likely related to methanogenesis and intermittent venting of deep-sourced CO2. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Authigenic carbonates; Authigenic siderite; Cold seep; Methanogenesis; REE; Stable isotopes; Sulfate-methane transition zone; Trace elements,Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical analysis; Exploratory geochemistry; Isotopes; Methane; Pyrites; Rare earths; Seawater; Seepage; Sulfur compounds; Surficial sediments; Trace elements; Underwater mineral resources; Volcanoes; Authigenic; Authigenic carbonates; Cold seeps; Methanogenesis; Stable isotopes; Sulfate-methane transitions; Structure (composition); authigenic mineral; carbonate; cold seep; methane; methanogenesis; rare earth element; seepage; stable isotope; sulfate; trace element; Calabria; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Paola Ridge,36.169088,15.36203,727,Cold Seeps,Italy,,Paola Basin,environmental,,,,,

Percent cover of algae and sessile invertebrates (a determinant of polychaete distribution) was classified into functional groups to disentangle the direct effects of low pH on polychaete abundance from the indirect effects of pH on habitat and other species associations. A total of 6459 polychaete specimens belonging to 83 taxa were collected. Polychaete species richness and abundance dramatically dropped under the extreme low pH conditions due to the disappearance of both calcifying and non-calcifying species. Differences in distribution patterns indicate that the decreasing pH modified the structure and biological traits of polychaete assemblages independent of changes in habitat. A detailed taxonomic analysis highlighted species-specific responses to OA, with closely related species having opposing responses to decreasing pH. This resulted in an increase in the abundance of filter feeders and herbivores with decreasing pH, while sessile polychaetes disappeared in the extreme low pH zones, and were replaced by discretely motile forms. Reproductive traits of the polychaete assemblages changed as well, with brooding species dominating the most acidified zones. The few taxa that were abundant in extreme low pH conditions showed high tolerance to OA (e.g. Amphiglena mediterranea, Syllis prolifera, Platynereis cf. dumerilii, Parafabricia mazzellae, Brifacia aragonensis), and are promising models for further studies on the responses of benthic organisms to the effects of reduced pH. © The authors 2016.",Algal cover; Annelida; Covariation; Functional trait analysis; Hard bottoms; Mediterranean Sea; Ocean acidification; PH gradient,algae; Amphiglena mediterranea; Annelida; Invertebrata; Platynereis dumerilii; Polychaeta; Typosyllis variegata,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,Polychaeta,,survival

Here, we examined the distribution of Fabriciidae (Annelida, Sabellida) species along a gradient of ocean acidification, caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) vent emissions in a shallow, coastal system off the island of Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). A total of 265 specimens of Fabriciidae, representing six species from five genera, were collected along the gradient. Most of the species were found across the entire CO2 gradient, suggesting polychaetes may have a high tolerance for ocean acidification in the future. Two of the species were new to science, and two of the genera were previously unrecorded in the Mediterranean. A full description of the new species Brifacia aragonensis sp. nov. and Parafabricia mazzellae sp. nov. is given, both of which were most abundant in the most acidified areas (pH 6.6-7.2). The geographical distribution and ecology of the new taxa, as well as of the other fabriciid species collected, is discussed.

A key to the Mediterranean Sea species of Amphiglena is also provided. Some taxa, however, remain for the moment undescribed due to the poor preservation of the old material, and the lack of the type material for this taxon. A major revision of all the Mediterranean material previously attributed to A. mediterranea from both morphological and molecular points of view is needed. © 2021 Magnolia Press.

All cells were of a spherical and vacuolated phenotype and internally stored globules of elemental sulfur. With a diameter of 24-65µm, Thiomargarita cells from the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially smaller than cells of previously described populations. A 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified and could be assigned to the Thiomargarita-resembling cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This sequence is monophyletic with published Thiomargarita sequences but sequence similarities are only about 94%, indicating a distinct diversification. In the investigated habitat, highly dynamic conditions favour Thiomargarita species over other sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast to Thiomargarita namibiensis populations, which rely on periodic resuspension from sulfidic sediment into the oxygenated water column, Thiomargarita cells at the Amon mud volcano seem to remain stationary at the sediment surface while environmental conditions change around them due to periodic brine flow. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",NA,"bacterial RNA; RNA 16S; sulfur; article; classification; ecosystem; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; microbiology; phylogeny; sediment; Thiotrichaceae; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; Mediterranean Sea; Phylogeny; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sulfur; Thiotrichaceae; Water Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gorgonacea; Thiomargarita; Thiomargarita namibiensis",Article,Scopus,Amon,32.36747,31.70457,1120,Mud Volcano,Egypt,methane-hydrocarbon,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

Using a combination of optical, SEM-EDS, micro-Raman and XANES/EXAFS applications, we investigated yellow-orange As- and S-rich sediments occurring in the shallow-water hydrothermal system off the coast of Milos Island, Greece. The precipitates have several morphologies, but are dominantly colloidal. Intriguing ""biological"" morphologies also exist (e.g., cell-like (~10µm), spirals (~20µm), and rounded ""cinnamon bun"" shapes (~20µm)). SEM-EDS data indicated that the precipitates have an As:S ratio similar to orpiment (average=0.58, range 0.51-0.63; n=8). Micro-Raman spectra indicated that orange colored precipitates appear to be dominated by poorly crystalline and/or amorphous arsenic sulfides with micro-amounts of more crystalline orpiment and impure sulfur. The yellow sediments also contained crystalline elemental sulfur in the form S8. Bulk As K-edge XANES spectra of the As-sulfide precipitates proved a valence of As corresponding to orpiment-type (As2S3) compounds (-1 to +3). EXAFS fitting results indicated that the studied material exhibits an amorphous orpiment-like structure with As ions coordinated by 3 sulfur atoms (CN=3.0). The As-S interatomic distance of the first shell is calculated at 2.279Å and the Debye-Waller factor (s2) is 0.00427. These data suggest that the modeled structure of the studied precipitates is slightly S-deficient and ordered only in the first shell around As, resembling an orpiment-type structure, whereas higher shells are not present and must be disordered. The disorder phenomenon may be strictly produced either by the existence of occasional As-S-As bridges with As-As bonds or by the occurrence of As-O-As bridges, causing twisting of the AsS3 pyramids in the initial orpiment structure. This distortion in the higher coordination shells of the structural sheets creates the amorphous orpiment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Aegean Sea; Amorphous; Arsenic sulfide; Cyclades; Hellenic Volcanic Arc; Hydrothermal; Marine; Milos Island; Orpiment,amorphous medium; arsenic; hydrothermal vent; precipitation (chemistry); scanning electron microscopy; shell; sulfur; Aegean Sea; Cyclades; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Milos [Cyclades]; Milos [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Cinnamomum verum,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,32,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Authigenic carbonate crusts were observed directly by a submersible in each of these fluid-venting areas, in close association with specific chemosynthetic biological communities. Authigenic carbonates occur typically as pavements, slabs and mounds on the seafloor, but are also present as millimeter- to centimeter-size concretions dispersed within sediments. Mineralogical analyses of carbonate crusts and concretions indicate that aragonite and high-Mg calcite represent the most dominant carbonate phases. Low-Mg calcite, dolomite and ankerite also occur as minor components. Petrographic observations of carbonate crusts and concretions show that they are composed mainly of microcrystalline carbonate cement, with minor amounts of detrital minerals, lithoclasts and bioclasts. Aragonite is present as microcrystalline cement or acicular crystals infilling bioclasts and voids. Pyrite occurs as framboids or cubic crystals, which are often associated with authigenic carbonates, thereby indicating that sulfate reduction was active during carbonate precipitation. Numerous millimeter- to centimeter-size euhedral gypsum crystals have been observed within carbonate crusts and concretions, and as isolated crystals in sediments recovered from the eastern province. In this area, precipitation of gypsum is related to the presence of rising sulfate-rich fluids, which originate from the dissolution of underlying Messinian evaporites. Millimeter-size barite concretions have also been discovered in sediment from the central province and precipitated from ascending fluids, which are enriched in barium due to the dissolution of biogenic and/or authigenic barite below the depth of sulfate depletion. The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates display very large ranges, from -0.67‰ to 4.15‰ Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (V-PDB) and from -42.14‰ to 3.10‰ V-PDB, respectively. Most carbonates exhibit d18O values around 3‰, indicating that they have precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with bottom seawater. In contrast, two carbonate concretions from the caldera and the eastern areas are characterized by lower d18O values (-0.67‰ V-PDB and 0.98‰ V-PDB), which may reflect a contribution from 18O-poor (continental?) water or, most likely, a local high heat flow. A few carbonate crusts exhibit slightly positive d13C values, which indicate that seawater was the main source of carbon for those carbonates.

Mineralogical analyses of carbonate crusts and concretions indicate that aragonite and high-Mg calcite represent the most dominant carbonate phases. Low-Mg calcite, dolomite and ankerite also occur as minor components. Petrographic observations of carbonate crusts and concretions show that they are composed mainly of microcrystalline carbonate cement, with minor amounts of detrital minerals, lithoclasts and bioclasts. Aragonite is present as microcrystalline cement or acicular crystals infilling bioclasts and voids. Pyrite occurs as framboids or cubic crystals, which are often associated with authigenic carbonates, thereby indicating that sulfate reduction was active during carbonate precipitation. Numerous millimeter- to centimeter-size euhedral gypsum crystals have been observed within carbonate crusts and concretions, and as isolated crystals in sediments recovered from the eastern province. In this area, precipitation of gypsum is related to the presence of rising sulfate-rich fluids, which originate from the dissolution of underlying Messinian evaporites. Millimeter-size barite concretions have also been discovered in sediment from the central province and precipitated from ascending fluids, which are enriched in barium due to the dissolution of biogenic and/or authigenic barite below the depth of sulfate depletion. The oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates display very large ranges, from -0.67‰ to 4.15‰ Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (V-PDB) and from -42.14‰ to 3.10‰ V-PDB, respectively. Most carbonates exhibit d18O values around 3‰, indicating that they have precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with bottom seawater. In contrast, two carbonate concretions from the caldera and the eastern areas are characterized by lower d18O values (-0.67‰ V-PDB and 0.98‰ V-PDB), which may reflect a contribution from 18O-poor (continental?) water or, most likely, a local high heat flow. A few carbonate crusts exhibit slightly positive d13C values, which indicate that seawater was the main source of carbon for those carbonates. Authigenic carbonates are typically depleted in 13C, revealing that the major carbon source for those carbonates derives from anaerobic oxidation of methane driven by microbial consortia of archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A diverse set of 13C-depleted archaeal and bacterial lipids were detected along this crust with d13C values as low as - 118‰. This provides evidence that anaerobic oxidation of methane was the main process that induced the formation of this carbonate crust. Archaeal lipid biomarker distributions revealed the presence of archaea belonging both to the ANME-1 and ANME-2 phylogenetic clusters, with the former predominating. The distribution and compound specific d13C values of AOM-derived lipid biomarkers showed no significant variations with depth.

However, so far, most studies have focused on calcifiers. We present the first study of the effects of ocean acidification on the Porifera. Sponge species composition and cover along pH gradients at CO2 vents off Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) was measured at sites with normal pH (8.1-8.2), lowered pH (mean 7.8-7.9, min 7.4-7.5) and extremely low pH (6.6). There was a strong correlation between pH and both sponge cover and species composition. Crambe crambe was the only species present in any abundance in the areas with mean pH 6.6, seven species were present at mean pH 7.8-7.9 and four species (Phorbas tenacior, Petrosia fici-formis, Chondrilla nucula and Hemimycale columella) were restricted to sites with normal pH. Sponge percentage cover decreased significantly from normal to acidified sites. No significant effect of increasing CO2 levels and decreasing pH was found on spicule form in Crambe crambe. This study indicates that increasing CO2 concentrations will likely affect sponge community composition as some demosponge species appear to be more vulnerable than others.

The focus is on a medium-sized CO2 release from 294 identified small point sources around Panarea Island (South-East Tyrrhenian Sea, Aeolian Islands, Italy) in water depths of about 40-50 m. This study evaluates how multiple CO2 seep sites generate a temporally variable plume of dissolved CO2. The model also allows the overall flow rate of CO2 to be estimated based on field measurements of pH. Simulations indicate a release of -6900 t y-1 of CO2 for the investigated area and highlight an important role of seeps located at &gt;20 m water depth in the carbon budget of the Panarea offshore gas release system. This new transport-reaction model provides a framework for understanding potential future leaks from CO2 storage sites. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",NA,"Budget control; Flow rate; Numerical methods; Offshore oil well production; Advection dispersions; Aeolian islands , Italy; Analytical method; Field measurement; Mitigation options; Natural laboratories; Sub-seabed storages; Transport-reaction models; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; water; advection-diffusion equation; analytical method; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolved matter; field method; leakage; mitigation; warming; water depth; advection; Article; carbon dioxide tension; carbon storage; climate warming; environmental impact; flow rate; gas flow; island (geological); Italy; pH; plume; plume dispersion; Tyrrhenian Sea; water sampling; water temperature; Italy; Lipari Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Messina [Sicily]; Panarea; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonates; Islands; Italy; Water",Article,Scopus,PCTD3,38.642811,15.086486,45,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The prokaryotic community composition in surface sediment samples was analyzed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA at two time points that differed mainly with respect to temperature conditions, high-temperature (94 A degrees C, HT09) and low-temperature (28.5 A degrees C, LT10). Bacterial richness and diversity were greater than those of Archaea under both temperature conditions. In contrast to Bacteria, diversity and evenness of Archaea greatly increased at LT10. While the phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of members mostly affiliated with the same taxonomic groups, their relative abundances differed from HT09 to LT10, resulting in different bacterial and archaeal assemblages. Both HT09 and LT10 were dominated by members of the Epsilonproteobacteria. Within this subphylum, bacteria of the genus Sulfurimonas were most frequently detected at HT09, while Arcobacter prevailed at LT10. The abundance of other dominant taxonomic groups (a parts per thousand yen1 % of Illumina reads) also correlated with temperature conditions. Members assigned to hyperthermophilic Euryarchaeota (Thermococci) or to thermophilic (Caldiserica) and thermoresistant (Firmicutes) bacterial taxa were dominant at HT09, while those related to non-thermophilic Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant at LT10. Several, probably photosynthetic, members of the Alphaproteobacteria, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi were recovered under both temperature conditions.

For cold seep sediments of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, depth-dependent methane concentrations and rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) are constrained by modeling the measured pore-water sulfate profile. The calculated dissolved methane distribution and flux are sensitive to the advective flow velocity, which is estimated from the depth distributions of conservative pore-water constituents (Na, B). Near-complete anaerobic oxidation of the upward methane flux of ~6.0 mol m-2 yr-1 is supported by the depth distributions of indicative biomarkers, and the carbon isotopic compositions of organic matter and dissolved inorganic carbon. Pore-water and solid-phase data are consistent with a narrow depth interval of AOM, 14-18 cm below the sediment-water interface. Based on an isotopic mass balance, the biomass of the microbial population carrying out oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction at the given methane flux represents ~20% of the total organic carbon, which is a significant pool of in situ formed organic matter. Model results indicate that the asymptotic methane concentration is reached a few meters below the sediment surface. The predicted asymptotic concentration is close to the in situ saturation value with respect to gas hydrate, suggesting that the rate of shallow gas hydrate formation is controlled by the ascending methane flux. The proposed model approach can be used to predict the formation of gas hydrate, and to quantify methane fluxes plus transformation rates in surface sediments where fluid advection is an important transport mechanism. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most prominently, the shells recorded the shock of transplantation, both in their shell ultrastructure, textural and geochemical record. Shell calcite, precipitated subsequently under acidified seawater responded to the pH gradient by an in part disturbed ultrastructure. Geochemical data from all test sites show a strong metabolic effect that exceeds the influence of the low-pH environment.

Layers of varying depths in the Kazan sediments were investigated in terms of (1) chemical parameters and (2) DNA-based microbial population structures. The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm). Communities in the middle layer (6-22 cm) contained organisms that could be linked to either of the aforementioned processes. We discuss how these phylogeny (sequence)-based findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the functioning and the functional diversities of the communities under study. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; lipid; methane; primer DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; Archaebacterium; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; conference paper; ecosystem; gene library; genetics; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; Methanosarcina; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; sediment; Archaea; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Biodiversity; DNA Primers; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Ecosystem; Environmental Microbiology; Gene Library; Geologic Sediments; Lipids; Mediterranean Sea; Methane; Methanosarcinales; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Proceedings Paper,Scopus,Kazan,35.67565,30.51171,1700,Mud Volcano,Turkey,,Anaximander Mountains,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

The composition of the mat community was characterized using a combination of phylogenetic and lipid biomarker methods. The mat sample was filtered through 0.2 and 5-µm filters to coarsely separate unicellular and filamentous bacteria. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from the total community DNA from these fractions showed that similar archaeal populations were present in both fractions. However, the bacterial populations in the fractions differed from one another, and were more diverse than the archaeal ones. Lipid analysis showed that bacteria were the dominant members of the mat microbial community and the relatively low d13C carbon isotope values of bulk bacterial lipids suggested the occurrence of methane- and sulfide-based chemo(auto)trophy. Consistent with this, the bacterial populations in the fractions were related to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria, most of which were chemoautotrophic bacteria that utilize hydrogen sulfide (or reduced sulfur compounds) and/or methane. The most common archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were related to those of previously identified Archaea capable of anaerobic methane oxidation. Although the filamentous organisms observed in the mat were not conclusively identified, our results indicated that the Eastern Mediterranean deep-sea microbial mat community might be sustained on a combination of methane- and sulfide-driven chemotrophy. © 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

During the Marsite cruise (November 2014), dives with Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) VICTOR 6000 focused on detailed seafloor explorations of four different areas: the Central and Western highs and the Tekirdag and cinarcik basins. Based on 130 h of in situ videos, high-resolution seafloor mapping of seeps was conducted, emphasizing their significant geological and biological diversity from one seeping site to another, from one basin/high to another. Gas bubbles (CH4, CO2), shimmering water (brine, marine and fresh water) and oil, escape from the seafloor into the water column with low to strong fluxes. Black patches of reduced sediments, authigenic carbonate crusts and chimneys compose the seep environments with various types of bacterial mats and chemosynthetic fauna. Several venting sites discovered during previous cruises are still active 7-12 years later. The seeps are mostly, but not only, focalized along the Main Marmara Fault (MMF), at the southern border of the Tekirdag Basin and along the Western High.

Most of the symbiont-bearing taxa encountered and previously sampled in the Marmara Sea, are characterized by thiotrophic symbioses. Vesicomyids and Idas sp. mussels are present at gas seeps, but also in areas where crude oil escapes from the seafloor. Moreover, other taxa unusually encountered at cold seeps such as large-sized amphipod and vagile worms were observed in the cinarcik Basin. Idas-like mussels were observed in the western part of the Sea of Marmara, in the Tekirdag Basin and possibly on the Western High active seep sites. There, the sampled fluids had high methane content (reaching 65 mu mol/l) but not as high as on the Central High (363 timo1/1) and cinarcik Basin (228 mu mol/l) where no mussels were observed in the video records.

These oxygen conditions, which fall under the limit of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ <20 mu m/l) in the eastern part, may impact benthic fauna and explain the absence of symbiotrophic bivalves at cold seep sites of the cinarcik Basin, whereas densely aggregated amphipods, likely more tolerant to oxygen stress were observed in the seepage area. Finally, no specific fauna was observed near the CO2-rich seep sites.

This is the first record of a vestimentiferan species in the western basin of the Mediterranean, an area with direct connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar and therefore of great importance to the study of distributional patterns and evolution of Mediterranean species. We examine the current hypotheses on the biogeographic distribution of vestimentiferan species in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea and conclude that independently of when Lamellibrachia colonized the Mediterranean, neither the present hydrological settings of both Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, nor vestimentiferans reproductive biology are impeditive to the presence of the Mediterranean species of Lamellibrachia in the NE Atlantic.

Element enrichment in the investigated areas off Methana corresponds in terms of absolute concentrations and element suite to comparable hydrothermally influenced sediments from other locations of the Hellenic volcanic arc. The region between Methana peninsula and Aegina Island is not marked by vigorous hydrothermal activity, but localised enrichments of Fe and/or Mn, As, Sb as well as associated trace elements typically found in hydrothermally influenced sediments were identified. © 2003 Elsevier GmbH.

MS is interpreted as the ridge of the 2Ma old Marsili back-arc basin belonging to the Calabrian Arc-Ionian Sea subduction system (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). Previous studies indicate that the MS activity developed between 1 and 0.1Ma through effusions of lava flows. Here, new stratigraphic, textural, geochemical, and 14C geochronological data from a 95cm long gravity core (COR02) recovered at 839mbsl in the MS central sector are presented. COR02 contains mud and two tephras consisting of 98 to 100 area% of volcanic ash. The thickness of the upper tephra (TEPH01) is 15cm, and that of the lower tephra (TEPH02) is 60cm. The tephras have poor to moderate sorting, loose to partly welded levels, and erosive contacts, which imply a short distance source of the pyroclastics. 14C dating on fossils above and below TEPH01 gives an age of 3kaBP. Calculations of the sedimentation rates from the mud sediments above and between the tephras suggest that a formation of TEPH02 at 5kaBP MS ashes has a high-K calcalkaline affinity with 53wt.%&lt;SiO2&lt;68wt.%, and their composition overlaps that of the MS lava flows. The trace element pattern is consistent with fractional crystallization from a common, OIB-like basalt. The source area of ashes is the central sector of MS and not a subaerial volcano of the Campanian and/or Aeolian Quaternary volcanic districts. Submarine, explosive eruptions occurred at MS in historical times: this is the first evidence of explosive volcanic activity at a significant (500-800mbsl) water depth in the Mediterranean Sea. MS is still active, the monitoring and an evaluation of the different types of hazards are highly recommended. © 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.",Back-arc; Explosive eruption; Hazard; Holocene tephra; Submarine active volcanism,backarc basin; deep water; explosive volcanism; hazard assessment; historical record; seamount; submarine volcano; tephra; volcanic eruption; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Marsili,39.26,14.378,3180,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The active fluid emission area is located on the outer shelf, between 110 and 130. m water depth, and affects the Late Quaternary lowstand and highstand deposits resting on rocky bedrock. A variety of fluid-escape features characterizes the area, including the Zannone giant pockmark, several smaller pockmarks, hummocky terrains and areas of positive relief. Ground-truth video data show active seepages, bacterial communities, widespread lithified pavements, mounds, and cone-shaped structures. Evidence of active seepage includes both continuous and intermittent bubble release from the seafloor and a well-defined plume rising 70. m above the seafloor.The Zannone giant pockmark is about 900×500m (surface of some 0.5km2). It represents the first evidence of an active shallow-water seepage area in the central Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy) and the first record of a morphologically complex giant pockmark in the entire Mediterranean Sea.Some speculations on processes originating the observed features are explored, including possible occurrence of multiple eruption events, processes of fluidization-liquefaction and minor slides that may have modified the original morphology. Factors peculiar to the study area - shallow depth, thin sedimentary cover resting on a faulted rocky basement, seeping occurring through non-cohesive sandy sediments - appear to have been key to the formation and morphology of the Zannone giant pockmark. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Active seepage; Bacterial communities; Lithified pavements; Seafloor collapses; Shallow-water giant pockmark,Bacteria; Bathymetry; Fluidization; Morphology; Pavements; Bacterial community; Central Mediterranean; High resolution seismic; Multibeam bathymetry; Sea floor; Sedimentary covers; Shallow waters; Very high resolution; Seepage; geomorphology; marine sediment; microbial community; pockmark; seafloor; seepage; shallow water; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Bacteria (microorganisms),Article,Scopus,Zannone,40.972222,13.103056,150,Pockmarks,Italy,,Pontine Archipelago,environmental,,,,,

Natural CO2 gradients off Vulcano, Italy, have revealed profound ecosystem changes along rocky shore habitats as carbonate saturation levels decrease, but no investigations have yet been made of the sedimentary habitat. Here, we sampled the upper 2 cm of volcanic sand in three zones, ambient (median pCO2 419 µatm, minimum Oarag 3.77), moderately CO2-enriched (median pCO2 592 µatm, minimum Oarag 2.96), and highly CO2-enriched (median pCO2 1611 µatm, minimum Oarag 0.35). We tested the hypothesis that increasing levels of seawater pCO2 would cause significant shifts in sediment bacterial community composition, as shown recently in epilithic biofilms at the study site. In this study, 454 pyrosequencing of the V1 to V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a shift in community composition with increasing pCO2. The relative abundances of most of the dominant genera were unaffected by the pCO2 gradient, although there were significant differences for some 5 % of the genera present (viz. Georgenia, Lutibacter, Photobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Paenibacillus), and Shannon Diversity was greatest in sediments subject to long-term acidification (&gt;100 years). Overall, this supports the view that globally increased ocean pCO2 will be associated with changes in sediment bacterial community composition but that most of these organisms are resilient. However, further work is required to assess whether these results apply to other types of coastal sediments and whether the changes in relative abundance of bacterial taxa that we observed can significantly alter the biogeochemical functions of marine sediments. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",NA,"Acinetobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Georgenia; Lutibacter; Paenibacillus; Photobacterium; carbon dioxide; RNA 16S; sea water; Bacteria; bacterial gene; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; pH; polymerase chain reaction; sediment; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,Scopus,Vulcano,38.4,15,1,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

Using a georeferenced photographic map of Paleochori Bay, more than 160 porewater samples were collected and the exact GPS coordinates reported. The GPS coordinates of the sampling locations should provide a foundation for future research in Paleochori Bay by enabling reliable repeat measurements. Hydrothermally influenced porewaters had low pH, elevated arsenic (As) concentrations, and had temperatures between 23.6 and 122.4 °C. The samples were divided into two distinct groups, which had either Cl concentrations below or above the reference seawater. The high-Cl fluids were enriched in K, Ca, Sr and Br and depleted in Mg and SO4 compared to seawater or the low-Cl fluids. However, both fluid types were enriched relative to seawater in As and Si by up several orders of magnitude. Oxygen and deuterium isotope analyses indicated a seawater origin for the fluids with a minor contribution from meteoric water (low-Cl fluids) and arc magmatic water (high-Cl fluids). As previously reported, both high- and low-Cl fluids discharge throughout the bay, often within a few meters of each other. However, high-resolution sampling, together with exact spatial information in the form of GPS coordinates, allowed us to determine that the low-Cl fluids discharge across the bay, while the high-Cl fluid discharge in particular regions of the bay. Based on the distribution of the d2H and Na/K values in porewater and the occurrence of microbial mats, we pinpointed a set of deep-seated faults, which seem to control the distribution of hydrothermal vs. non-hydrothermal areas in the bay. At 54 locations, porewater temperature profiles were obtained to calculate fluid flux from the hydrothermal areas in Paleochori Bay, which was determined to be 11,300 ± 1100 m3/day. This value allowed to further calculate an annual As input of approximately 1.5 × 104 kg into the Mediterranean Sea. © 2021 The Author(s)",Arsenic; Hydrothermal flux; Hydrothermal system; Milos; MSWHS; Shallow-water,Arsenic compounds; Calcium compounds; Chlorine; Global positioning system; Location; Magnesium compounds; Seawater; Fluid discharge; GPS Coordinates; Hydrothermal areas; Hydrothermal fluxes; Hydrothermal system; Milo; MSWHS; Pore waters; Shallow waters; Spatial and temporal variability; Arsenic; arsenic; concentration (composition); deuterium; GPS; hydrothermal system; hydrothermal vent; isotopic analysis; oxygen isotope; pH; porewater; shallow water; temperature profile; water chemistry; Cyclades; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Milos [Cyclades]; Milos [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,15,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Sediment and water column samples from two contrasting sites in the English Channel (mud and sand) were incubated (up to 14 weeks) in CO2- acidified seawater ranging from pH 8.0 to pH 6.1. Additional observations were made off the island of Ischia (Mediterranean Sea), a natural analogue site, where long-term thermogenic CO2 ebullition occurs (from pH 8.2 to pH 7.6). Water column ammonia oxidation rates in English Channel samples decreased under low pH with near-complete inhibition at pH 6.5. Water column Ischia samples showed a similar though not statistically significant trend. However, sediment ammonia oxidation rates at all three locations were not affected by reduced pH. These observations may be explained by buffering within sediments or low-pH adaptation of the microbial ammonia oxidizing communities.

In this study, we investigated the global distribution and abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in eight gas and hydrocarbon seeps by catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). The majority of Deltaproteobacteria were assigned to specific SRB groups, i.e. 83 +/- 14% at gas seeps and 61 +/- 35% at hydrocarbon seeps, indicating that the probe set used was sufficient for classification of marine SRB. Statistical analysis showed that SRB abundance and distribution were significantly influenced by habitat type and sediment depth. Members of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade strongly dominated all sites. Our data indicated the presence of many diverse and highly specialized DSS species of low abundance rather than a single abundant subgroup. In addition, SEEP-SRB2, an uncultured deep-branching deltaproteobacterial group, was ubiquitously found in high abundances at all sites. SEEP-SRB2 members occurred either in a novel association with methanotrophic archaea in shell-type ANME-2/SEEP-SRB2 consortia, in association with ANME-1 archaea in Black Sea microbial mats or as single cells.

To understand how these opportunistic metazoans survive in ephemeral reducing habitats, individuals of the small bathymodiolin, Idas modiolaeformis, were examined histologically to trace their reproductive development, and with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy to identify patterns of infection by their environmentally acquired bacterial symbionts. A size series of these mussels was retrieved from larval colonisation devices containing vegetative substrates, deployed for 51 weeks (November 2006-2007) in the central 'Pockmarks' region (site 2A) of the Nile deep-sea fan in the eastern Mediterranean (NDSF), a zone where methane seepage can occur (N 32° 31.97, E 30° 21.18, 1,693 m deep). Developmental patterns of germ cell migration, size at first maturity, and symbiont acquisition and localisation are presented for the post-larva to adult transition. The smallest mature adult was a male with shell length (SL) 2.35 mm. All larger individuals in the series were male (maximum SL 6.54 mm). Based on the absence of bacterial signals, plantigrades were asymbiotic, indicating strict heterotrophy in larvae and early post-larvae. During the early stages of dissoconch deposition, extracellular symbiont infection was non-specific. This was followed by increasing specificity on non-ciliated gill epithelia in adults. These observations on early development in I. modiolaeformis represent evolutionary adaptations to their ephemeral, reducing habitats. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,adaptation; anatomy; bacterium; biological development; bivalve; environmental change; host-symbiont interaction; maturation; seepage; size at maturity; symbiosis; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bathymodiolinae; Gorgonacea; Idas; Metazoa,Article,Scopus,Pockmarks Area,32.533056,30.3525,1693,Pockmarks,Egypt,,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,biological,,macrobenthos,Bivalvia,Idas modiolaeformis,reproduction

It has been proposed that carbonate growth results in self-sealing, but little is known regarding the evolution of cold seep structures in relation to fluid migration pathways. This study investigates structures resulting from gas seepage along ring faults peripheral to Venere mud volcano (1600 m water depth), based on multibeam bathymetry and seafloor backscatter data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle, together with photomosaics, video observations, and samples obtained by a remotely operated vehicle. Sites of focused fluid flow are identified by gas bubble streams rising from the seafloor while anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) over wider areas is indicated by the occurrence of chemosynthesis-based organisms (microbial mats, vesicomyid clams, vestimentiferan tube worms). At some sites, flakes of gas hydrate were observed in the water column during sampling. A range of carbonate structures exists at these sites: 1) flat and extensive pavements; 2) mounds with disseminated nodules or centimeter-thick crusts; 3) fractured mounds with exposed, decimeter-thick crusts; and 4) seafloor depressions lined by decimeter-thick crusts. The mineralogy and stable carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates are consistent with anaerobic oxidation of methane from thermogenic sources, and possible near-seabed influence of gas hydrate formation and dissolution. The seafloor expressions of seepage are inferred to be controlled by the interaction of fluid flow due to carbonate precipitation and gas hydrate formation. A conceptual model for mound development is proposed in the context of the known timescales of seep-colonization and rates of carbonate precipitation: (A) the onset of hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage through hemipelagic sediments leads to (B) the establishment of microbial mats on flat seafloor over decadal timescales and is followed by (C) the growth of pavements cemented by carbonates that seal the seafloor; over longer timescales (centuries to millennia), carbonate growth and subsurface gas hydrate formation/dissolution lead to (D) upward doming and fracturing of carbonate mounds, re-sealing and stacking of carbonates and in some cases to (E) their collapse to form seafloor depressions. Gas migration through fractures in the carbonates allows re-sealing and fuels AOM to provide habitats for chemosynthesis-based fauna. This evolutionary scenario is argued to be broadly applicable to the development of ruptured mounds and collapse features described at other seepage sites in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Calabrian Accretionary Prism; Carbonate seal; Cold seep; Mud volcano; Photomosaic; Tube worms,Autonomous underwater vehicles; Bathymetry; Carbonates; Carbonation; Flow of fluids; Gas hydrates; Gases; Hydration; Methane; Microorganisms; Minerals; Pavements; Remotely operated vehicles; Seepage; Underwater mineralogy; Volcanoes; Accretionary prism; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Carbonate precipitation; Central Mediterranean; Cold seeps; Mud volcanoes; Photomosaic; Vestimentiferan tube worms; Fracturing (fossil fuel deposits); authigenic mineral; carbonate platform; cold seep; collapse; gas hydrate; gas seepage; mud mound; mud volcano; seafloor; sealing; volcanology; Mediterranean Sea; Bivalvia; Tubicolae; Vesicomyidae,Article,Scopus,Venere,38.618383,17.193667,1600,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Calabrian Arc,environmental,,,,,

The morphology of a mud volcano can record its extrusive history and processes of erosion and deformation affecting it. The study of offshore mud volcano dynamics is limited because only few have been mapped at resolutions that reveal their detailed surface structures. More importantly, rates and volumes of extruded sediment and methane are poorly constrained. The 100 m high twin cones of Venere mud volcano are situated at approximate to 1,600 m water depth within Squillace Canyon along the Ionian Calabrian margin, Mediterranean Sea. Seafloor bathymetry and backscatter data obtained by a ship-based system and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) allow mapping of mudflow deposits of the mud volcano and bedforms in the surrounding canyon. Repeated surveying by AUV document active mud movement at the western summit in between 2014 and 2016. Through sediment coring and tephrochronology, ages of buried mudflow deposits are determined based on the sedimentation rate and the thickness of overlying hemipelagic sediments. An average extrusion rate of 27,000 m(3)/yr over the last approximate to 882 years is estimated. These results support a three-stage evolutionary model of Venere mud volcano since approximate to 4,000 years ago. It includes the onset of quiescence at the eastern cone (after approximate to 2,200 years ago), erosive events in Squillace Canyon (prior to approximate to 882 years ago), and mudflows from the eastern cone (since approximate to 882 years). This study reveals new interactions between a mud volcano and a canyon in the deep sea. Plain Language Summary Mud volcanoes are geological structures that can release large amounts of gas (methane) and sediments. Mud volcanoes are well studied on land but on the seafloor, where they are much more common, the volumes of released sediments and methane are poorly known. In this study, the evolution of an active submarine mud volcano is investigated by using sediment cores and an exceptionally detailed seafloor map. The ages of different mud outflow deposits are determined by measuring the amount of marine background sediments that have accumulated on top of them. Volumes of sediment, extruded by the mud volcano, are estimated based on the seafloor map and the combination of all results allows to calculate an average extrusion rate of the mudflows. This study highlights the value of detailed seafloor mapping to gain new insights and to quantify fundamental geological processes occurring at mud volcanoes on the seafloor.",mud volcano; mud breccia; AUV; submarine canyon; tephra; Calabrian Accretionary Prism,RIDGE ACCRETIONARY COMPLEX; MIGRATING SEDIMENT WAVES; DEEP-SEA FAN; IONIAN SEA; BLACK-SEA; CALABRIAN ARC; SEISMIC-REFLECTION; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; SIDESCAN SONAR; CYCLIC STEPS,Article,WOS,Venere,38.618383,17.193667,1600,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Calabrian Arc,environmental,,,,,

These findings corroborate previous studies demonstrating potential dissolution of carbonate skeletons in low pH seawater, while providing new insight into the possible ability of colonial species to respond to ocean acidification by adjusting resource allocation between zooids of different types. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Bryozoan; CO2; Mediterranean Sea; Ocean acidification; Polymorphism; Schizoporella,Bryozoa; Lophophora; Schizoporella; Schizoporella errata,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,Bryozoa,Schizoporella errata,growth

This appears to control mud expulsion at Carmen mud volcano, a cone-shaped structure 65 m high and 1 km in basal diameter. The presence of gas-rich mud breccia, living chemosynthetic fauna, the absence of hemipelagic draping and the abrupt transition that occurs between high dissolved sulfate in the uppermost interval and low sulfate together with high methane concentrations in the lowermost sediment interval all point to a recent expulsion of mud breccia at the summit of Carmen MV. For the lowermost interval, the depletion of major elements (i.e., Ca2+ and Mg2+) and the enrichment of trace species (i.e., Li and B) in the pore water all indicate a deep fluid source. The d18Opw (5.7‰ VSMOW) and dDpw (-10‰ VSMOW) of pore water in the lowermost interval correspond with smectite dehydration as the main pore-water freshening mechanism. Water-formation temperatures calculated with empirical geo-thermometers (K-Na, K-Mg; d18Opw, dDpw, and dissolved B) reveal that fluids were generated at temperatures of ~140 ± 20 °C. Taking a regional geothermal gradient for the WAB of 25–27 °C/km, this points to a fluid source from ~5 ± 1 km sediment depth. This is not only consistent with the depth of overpressurized shales and megabreccia of Lower to Middle Miocene age, but it also fits nicely with the Upper/Middle-Miocene seawater value for the porewater 87Sr/86Sr derived from dissolving carbonates. The stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of methane (d13Cmethane ~ -59.4‰ VPDB and dDmethane -184‰ VSMOW) for the deepest samples of summit-core GP05PC is consistent with the mentioned deep origin. Mud breccia expulsion of overpressurized deep sedimentary units would be accompanied by rigorous degassing, leading to rapid, ‘instantaneous’ replacement of pore fluid by bottom water in the upper sediments. The absence of oxidized sediment draping, the seawater-like pore-water composition in the uppermost part of the mud breccia interval, and the abrupt methane to sulfate transition all provide evidence for a very recent mud expulsion. The distinctively kink-shaped pore-water Cl- profile in core GP05PC has been used in a numerical transport-reaction model to derive the timing for this event. This eruptive event appears to have taken place very recently, namely 12 ± 5 yrs prior to the 2012 coring, thus in the year 2000 CE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Alboran Sea; Clay minerals; Deep fluids; Isotopes; Mud volcanoes; Pore waters,Binary alloys; Clay minerals; Dissolution; Isotopes; Magnesium alloys; Methane; Potassium alloys; Seawater; Sediments; Shale; Sodium alloys; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Alboran sea; Deep fluids; Methane concentrations; Mud volcanoes; Pore water freshening; Pore waters; Smectite dehydrations; Western Mediterranean; Volcanoes; bottom water; clay mineral; concentration (composition); geothermal gradient; hydrogen isotope; isotopic composition; megabreccia; methane; Miocene; mud; mud volcano; porewater; replacement; seawater; sediment chemistry; volcanism; volcano; Alboran Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (West),Article,Scopus,Carmen,35.721833,-4.734333,802,Mud Volcano,Morocco,,Alboran Basin,environmental,,,,,

By analogy, a steep decrease of seawater pH with depth is encountered inside the Kolumbo submarine volcano (northeast Santorini) as a result of natural CO2 venting, making this system ideal for ocean acidification research. Here, we investigated whether the increase of acidity towards deeper layers of Kolumbo crater had any effect on relevant phenotypic traits of bacterial isolates. A total of 31 Pseudomonas strains were isolated from both surface- (SSL) and deep-seawater layers (DSL), with the latter presenting a significantly higher acid tolerance. In particular, the DSL strains were able to cope with H+ levels that were 18 times higher. Similarly, the DSL isolates exhibited a significantly higher tolerance than SSL strains against six commonly used antibiotics and As(III). More importantly, a significant positive correlation was revealed between antibiotics and acid tolerance across the entire set of SSL and DSL isolates. Our findings imply that Pseudomonas species with higher resilience to antibiotics could be favored by the prospect of acidifying oceans. Further studies are required to determine if this feature is universal across marine bacteria and to assess potential ecological impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Acidification; Antibiotic/acid tolerance; Bacteria; Extreme environments; Heavy metals; Marine microbial ecology; Pseudomonas; Submarine volcanoes,Acidification; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Digital subscriber lines; Ecology; Heavy metals; Seawater; Submarines; Volcanoes; Ecological impacts; Extreme environment; Microbial ecology; Ocean acidifications; Positive correlations; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas species; Pseudomonas strain; Antibiotics; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; antimony derivative; arsenic derivative; cefuroxime; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; erythromycin; hydrogen; mercury derivative; sea water; strontium; tetracycline; acid; antiinfective agent; carbon dioxide; acidification; antibiotic resistance; carbon dioxide; heavy metal; marine environment; microbial activity; microbial ecology; submarine volcano; acid tolerance; acidification; acidity; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; controlled study; correlation analysis; Greece; Kolumbo submarine volcano; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; pH; phenotype; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas balearica; Pseudomonas stutzeri; RNA sequence; temperature; volcano; classification; drug effect; ecosystem; hydrothermal vent; isolation and purification; microbiology; sea; Aegean Sea; Kolumbo Volcano; Mediterranean Sea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Acids; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrothermal Vents; Oceans and Seas; Pseudomonas; Seawater,Article,Scopus,Kolumbo,36.525,25.4833,495,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

In the present study, we investigated the role of viral control and fluid emissions on prokaryote abundance, diversity, and community structure (total Archaea, total Bacteria, and sulphate-reducing bacteria) in waters and sediments surrounding the caldera of four different shallow-water hydrothermal vents (three located in the Mediterranean Sea and one in the Pacific Ocean). All vents, independent of their location, generally displayed a significant decrease of benthic prokaryote abundance, as well as its viable fraction, with increasing distance from the vent. Prokaryote assemblages were always dominated by Bacteria. Benthic Archaea accounted for 23-33% of total prokaryote abundance in the Mediterranean Sea and from 13 to 29% in the Pacific Ocean, whereas in the water column they accounted for 25-38%. The highest benthic bacterial ribotype richness was observed in close proximity of the vents (i.e., at 10-cm distance from the emissions), indicating that vent fluids might influence bacterial diversity in surrounding sediments. Virioplankton and viriobenthos abundances were low compared to other marine systems, suggesting that temperature and physical-chemical conditions might influence viral survival in these vent systems. We thus hypothesize that the high bacterial diversity observed in close proximity of the vents is related with the highly variable vent emissions, which could favor the coexistence of several prokaryotic species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; Archaebacterium; article; bacterium; biodiversity; ecosystem; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetics; growth, development and aging; Mediterranean Sea; microbiology; Pacific Ocean; population dynamics; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sediment; virus; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Mediterranean Sea; Pacific Ocean; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Population Dynamics; Viruses; Water Microbiology; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota",Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.5568,15.1097,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,bacteria,Prokaryotes,,survival

Here we document the in situ impact of submarine CO2 volcanic emissions (CO2 vents) on live shelled-pteropods (planktonic gastropods) species Creseis conica in the Gulf of Naples (Tyrrhenian Sea, Mediterranean). Since the currents inside the Gulf will likely drive those pelagic calcifying organisms into and out of the CO2 vent zones, we assume that pteropods will be occasionally exposed to the vents during their life cycle. Shell degradation and biomass were investigated in the stations located within and nearby the CO2 vent emission in relation to the variability of sea water carbonate chemistry. A relative decrease in shell biomass (22%), increase in incidence of shell fractures (38%) and extent of dissolution were observed in Creseis conica collected in the Gulf of Naples compared to those from the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea (control stations).

Here we present results obtained from shallow-water sea-floor sampling of barium-rich zinc and lead sulfides genetically analogous to Kuroko-type black ore on an active island arc. The samples come from a newly discovered, hydrothermally active depression on the submerged volcanic edifice of Panarea in the Aeolian island arc (Tyrrhenian Sea). Hydrothermal activity in the area is represented by extensive gas venting associated with white sea-floor aprons of sulfate and iron oxide precipitates.

GMM was deployed in April 2004 within an active gas-bearing pockmark in the Gulf of Patras (Greece), at a water depth of 42 m. Through a submarine cable linked to an onshore station, it was possible to remotely check, via direct phone connection, GMM functioning and to receive data in near-real time. Recordings were carried out in two consecutive campaigns over the periods April-July 2004, and September 2004-January 2005, amounting to a combined dataset of ca. 6.5 months. This represents the first long-term monitoring ever done on gas leakage from pockmarks by means of CH4+H2S+T+P sensors. The results show frequent T and P drops associated with gas peaks, more than 60 events in 6.5 months, likely due to intermittent, pulsation-like seepage. Decreases in temperature in the order of 0.1-1°C (up to 1.7°C) below an ambient T of ca. 17°C (annual average) were associated with short-lived pulses (10-60 min) of increased CH4+H2 S concentrations. This seepage ""pulsation"" can either be an active process driven by pressure build-up in the pockmark sediments, or a passive fluid release due to hydrostatic pressure drops induced by bottom currents cascading into the pockmark depression. Redundancy and comparison of data from different sensors were fundamental to interpret subtle proxy signals of temperature and pressure which would not be understood using only one sensor. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",NA,Hydrogen sulfide; Hydrostatic pressure; Methane; Seawater; Sediments; Seepage; Sensors; Submarine cables; Temperature; Cabled benthic observatory; Gas monitoring module; Methane-seeping pockmark; Passive fluid release; Oceanography; chemical composition; hydrogen sulfide; methane; pockmark; seafloor; seawater; seepage; Gulf of Patras; Ionian Sea; Mediterranean Sea,Article,Scopus,Patras Gulf,38.2125,21.7125,42,Pockmarks,Greece,,Eastern Mediterranean,environmental,,,,,

Delile and its epiphyte community were studied in three acidified stations located in two CO2 vents systems and one control station under normal pH conditions off the island of Ischia (Italy) to highlight the possible effects of ocean acidification. Plant phenology was analyzed every two months for one-year cycle (June 2016-April 2017), while epiphytes were studied in the period of highest development of both the leaf canopy and the epiphytic community (June, August, and October 2016). The shoot density of Posidonia beds in the acidified stations of the studied sites was significantly higher than that in the control area. Significant differences in the mean leaf length according to the pH condition, month, and the interaction of these two factors were observed (PERMANOVA); the mean leaf width differed also among pH conditions and months. We recorded lower leaf lengths and widths in the acidified stations in all the considered months, compared to those in the control station.

Hydrothermal fluids collected by scuba diving from active shallow hydrothermal venting areas on Milos Island in the Aegean Sea in East Mediterranean. Analysis carried out in suspended particles for Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ca, Ba, Sr, Li, Al and Si. During sampling, gas and water flux was measured and gas/water ratios were estimated. The data presented significant time and spatial variability. The gas flux values in Palaeochori Bay varied from 4.5 to 63 L/h and water flux varied from 25 to 92 L/h. In Voudia Bay varied from 0.8 to 32 L/h and the water flux found from 7 to 118 L/h while in Adamas Bay the gas flux values were from 2 to 13 L/h and the water flux found from 24 to 72 L/h. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) flux varied from 0.07 to 47 mg/L in Palaeochori Bay, between 2 and 19 mg/L and from 0.8 to 4 mg/L respectively in the three sites studied. Metal/Al ratios also vary significantly within a short distance between seeps in the same area. The pH of hydrothermal waters was from 5.21 to 6.63 in Palaeochori Bay, from 5.45 to 6.39 in Voudia Bay and from 5.69 to 6.10 in Adamas Bay suggesting either different mixing of fluids with seawater deeper in the substrate or perhaps that gases CO2 and H2S control pH values. Based on the geochemical properties found a common geothermal reservoir is suggested located below the surface of the island and annual fluxes of elemental particulates have been estimated. The main scope of this research is to evaluate the fluxes of gas and water and the main particulate geochemistry of hydrothermal venting fluids. Hydrothermal particles from the submarine vents studied were dominated by Fe, Ca, Si and Al and strongly enriched in Mn, Cu, Pb, Ca and Ba. The chemistry of particles emitted from seeps can strongly influence the local sediment geochemistry and element distribution on sea bottom locally while subjected to further transportation can also affect a much greater region. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Aegean Sea; basic metals; East Mediterranean; Hellenic Volcanic Arc; hydrothermal vents; Milos Island; particulate matter,Aluminum; Gases; Geothermal fields; Hot springs; Hydrogen sulfide removal (water treatment); Particles (particulate matter); Silicon; Submarines; Element distribution; Geochemical properties; Geothermal reservoir; Hydrothermal fluids; Sediment geochemistries; Spatial variability; Suspended particles; Suspended particulate matters; Hydrochemistry; gas flow; geochemistry; hydrothermal deposit; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal vent; pH; spatiotemporal analysis; suspended particulate matter; Aegean Sea; Cyclades; Greece; Hellenic Arc; Mediterranean Sea; Milos [Cyclades]; Milos [Southern Aegean]; Palaeochori Bay; Southern Aegean; Adamas,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,15,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Especially, gas seepages due to anthropogenic gas hydrate dissociation are big concerns recently. In the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Thessaloniki mud volcano was detected. Gas hydrate stability conditions in this mud volcano is very fragile. For this reason, in this study, gas seepages were predicted by using HydrateResSim at different seafloor temperature increments varying from 1 to 5 & #x000B0;C and different sediment permeability values varying from 0.1 mD to 5mD in Thessaloniki mud volcano. Both the effect of temperature increment (above 1 & #x000B0;C increment) and the increase in permeability cause faster gas hydrate dissociation. The gas seepages on the seafloor of Thessaloniki mud volcano was investigated in this study by using the bubble rise theory. It was found that the effect of gas bubble diameter is high on the height of gas flare in the study area. The effect of permeability and lithology near seafloor on gas release after gas hydrate dissociation is huge. Generally, in Thessaloniki MV, clays are dominant so it is advantageous for environment because even if gas hydrate dissociates, free gas reaches to the seafloor slowly. Moreover, since the next 100 years, it is expected that temperature will increase by +2 & #x000B0;C on the seafloor of Thessaloniki MV. It was indicated that gas release will be obvious if temperature increment is above 1 & #x000B0;C in this area according to the numerical simulations with HydrateResSim. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Gas hydrate; Gas seepage; Mediterranean sea; Methane; Mud volcano; Thessaloniki,Dissociation; Gas permeability; Gases; Hydration; Lithology; Methane; Seepage; Volcanoes; Eastern Mediterranean sea; Effect of temperature; Gas hydrate stabilities; Gas seepage; Mediterranean sea; Mud volcanoes; Temperature increment; Thessaloniki; Gas hydrates; gas hydrate; gas seepage; lithology; marine environment; methane; mud volcano; permeability; seafloor; Central Macedonia; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia],Article,Scopus,Thessaloniki,35.476717,30.251883,1264,Mud Volcano,Turkey,,Anaximander Mountains,environmental,,,,,

This acidification has the potential to cause significant perturbations to the physiology of ocean organisms, particularly those such as corals that build their skeletons/shells from calcium carbonate. Reduced ocean pH could also have an impact on the coral microbial community, and thus may affect coral physiology and health. Most of the studies to date have examined the impact of ocean acidification on corals and/or associated microbiota under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we report the first study that examines the changes in coral microbial communities in response to a natural pH gradient (mean pHT 7.3-8.1) caused by volcanic CO2 vents off Ischia, Gulf of Naples, Italy. Two Mediterranean coral species, Balanophyllia europaea and Cladocora caespitosa, were examined. The microbial community diversity and the physiological parameters of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) were monitored. We found that pH did not have a significant impact on the composition of associated microbial communities in both coral species. In contrast to some earlier studies, we found that corals present at the lower pH sites exhibited only minor physiological changes and no microbial pathogens were detected. Together, these results provide new insights into the impact of ocean acidification on the coral holobiont. © 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.",bacteria; coral; holobiont; microbial community; ocean acidification; pH,"RNA 16S; sea water; acidification; bacterium; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; community composition; community dynamics; coral; disturbance; ecosystem health; laboratory method; marine ecosystem; microbial activity; microbial community; pathogen; pH; physiology; seawater; surface water; animal; Anthozoa; article; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; genetics; metagenome; microbiology; pH; phylogeny; physiology; Animals; Anthozoa; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biodiversity; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Metagenome; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Campania [Italy]; Gulf of Naples; Ischia; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Napoli [Campania]; Tyrrhenian Sea; Anthozoa; Bacteria (microorganisms); Balanophyllia europaea; Cladocora caespitosa; Dinophyceae; Symbiodinium",Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,bacteria,coral microbial community,,survival

Due to a lack of evidence for offshore displacement and insignificant historical seismicity, the systems are thought to be inactive and the rift-related deformation is believed to have ceased. In this study we integrate aerial, marine and onshore geological, geophysical and geochemical data from the Maltese Islands to demonstrate that the majority of faults offshore the archipelago underwent extensional to transtensional deformation during the last 20 ka. We also document an active fluid flow system responsible for degassing of CH 4 and CO 2 . The gases migrate through carbonate bedrock and overlying sedimentary layers via focused pathways, such as faults and pipe structures, and possibly via diffuse pathways, such as fractures. Where the gases seep offshore, they form pockmarks and rise through the water column into the atmosphere. Gas migration and seepage implies that the onshore and offshore faults systems are permeable and that they were active recently and simultaneously. The latter can be explained by a transtensional system involving two right-stepping, right-lateral NW-SE trending faults, either binding a pull-apart basin between the islands of Malta and Gozo or associated with minor connecting antitethic structures.

For the first time, rapid habitat dominance shifts and altered competitive replacement from a reef-forming to a non-reef-forming biogenic habitat were documented over one-year exposure to low pH/high CO 2 through a transplant experiment off Vulcano Island CO 2 seeps (NE Sicily, Italy). Ocean acidification decreased vermetid reefs complexity via a reduction in the reef-building species density, boosted canopy macroalgae and led to changes in composition, structure and functional diversity of the associated benthic assemblages. OA effects on invertebrate richness and abundance were nonlinear, being maximal at intermediate complexity levels of vermetid reefs and canopy forming algae. Abundance of higher order consumers (e.g. carnivores, suspension feeders) decreased under elevated CO 2 levels. Herbivores were non-linearly related to OA conditions, with increasing competitive release only of minor intertidal grazers (e.g. amphipods) under elevated CO 2 levels. Our results support the dual role of CO 2 (as a stressor and as a resource) in disrupting the state of rocky shore communities, and raise specific concerns about the future of intertidal reef ecosystem under increasing CO 2 emissions. We contribute to inform predictions of the complex and nonlinear community effects of OA on biogenic habitats, but at the same time encourage the use of multiple natural CO 2 gradients in providing quantitative data on changing community responses to long-term CO 2 exposure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon dioxide; CO 2 vents; Ocean acidification; Phase shift; Transplant; Vermetid reef,"Acidification; Algae; Animals; Ecosystems; Oceanography; Phase shift; Reefs; Transplants; CO2 concentration; Community effects; Community response; Functional diversity; Intermediate complexity; Ocean acidifications; One year exposure; Suspension feeder; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; sea water; carbon dioxide; community response; dominance; ecosystem function; experiment; gastropod; nonlinearity; ocean acidification; reef formation; acidification; Article; canopy; density gradient; environmental impact; habitat quality; intertidal species; invertebrate; macroalga; marine environment; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; quantitative analysis; species composition; species richness; animal; biodiversity; biological model; ecosystem; invertebrate; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; nonlinear system; physiology; sea; snail; Italy; Lipari Islands; Messina [Sicily]; Sicily; Vulcano; algae; Amphipoda; Anthozoa; Invertebrata; Mollusca; Vermetidae; Animals; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Invertebrates; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Models, Biological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Snails",Article,Scopus,Vulcano,38.4,15,1,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,macrobenthos,,,survival

Here we used temperate shallow CO2 vents located around the coast of Ischia island (Italy) to assess the effects of OA on necto-benthic fish assemblages associated with the foundation seagrass species Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea. We compared P. oceanica meadow structure, its epiphytic community and the associated fish assemblage structure and diversity at vents with low pH sites and reference sites with ambient pH using underwater visual census strip transects, in two seasons (fall 2018 and summer 2019). Data were analysed using both univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results showed greater P. oceanica habitat complexity (i.e. shoot density) and lower abundance of epiphytic calcareous species (e.g. coralline algae) at the vents than reference sites. Total abundance of adult and juvenile fish was higher at vents than reference sites, while no differences were found for species richness and composition. Overall, the herbivore Sarpa salpa stands out among the species contributing the most to dissimilarity between vents and reference sites, showing higher abundances under OA conditions. This pattern could be explained by the combined effect of a positive response to the higher structural meadows complexity and the greater seagrasses palatability/nutritional value occurring at the vents, which may help herbivores to withstand the higher energetic cost to live under high pCO2/low pH conditions.

Here, we measured Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn levels at six CO2 seeps and six reference sites in the Mediterranean. Some seep sediments had elevated metal concentrations; an extreme example was Cd which was 43x more concentrated at a seep site than its corresponding reference site. Three seeps had metal levels that were predicted to adversely affect marine biota, namely Vulcano (for Hg), Ischia (for Cu) and Paleochori (for Cd and Ni).

We investigated the ecological consequences of CO2 leakage for a marine benthic ecosystem.

The combined use of a varied array of sampling methods was effective in obtaining a rich faunal inventory. Deep and offshore sites tended to be richer in species than shallow and inshore sites. In all cases species richness was higher at sites closest to hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.

For each species, depth distribution and habitat were recorded. Their ecology at Milos was consistent with previous knowledge in other areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The corallites of Caryophyllia inornata (and perhaps other species) were comparatively small-sized, thus apparently conforming to the so-called ‘eastern nanism’ (i.e., high occurrence of dwarf individuals in the Aegean as compared to the western Mediterranean) for many Mediterranean benthic species. Madracis pharensis was very common, especially in sites close to vents, locally covering up to 30% of the primary rock with a calcareous crust. Skeletal bulk density (1.95–2.10 g-cm-3) was higher, and porosity (29%) lower, than in typical constructional corals. Layering of distinct generations of colonies suggests the significant accretion of a persistent biogenic substratum. It cannot be excluded that the construction potential of the species is enhanced by the hydrothermal activity: impulses of heat from vents maintain water temperature warmer during winter, and emission of Ca and CO2 may favour the biological deposition of carbonates and/or the activity of symbiotic zooxanthellae. © 2000 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Bioconstruction; Cnidaria; Corals; Hydrothermal vents; Mediterranean Sea,community composition; coral; hydrothermal vent; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Alcyonaria; Anthozoa; Caryophyllia inornata; Cnidaria; Coelenterata; Madracis pharensis; Scleractinia; Zoantharia,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,15,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,biological,,macrobenthos,Anthozoa,,survival

These calcified structures can protect organisms from predation and improve access to light, nutrients and dispersive currents. While some species (such as urchins, corals and mussels) survive with decreased calcification, they can suffer from inferior mechanical performance. Here, we used cantilever beam theory to test the hypothesis that decreased calcification would impair the mechanical performance of the green alga Acetabularia acetabulum along a CO2 gradient created by volcanic seeps off Vulcano, Italy. Calcification and mechanical properties declined as calcium carbonate saturation fell; algae at 2283 matm CO2 were 32% less calcified, 40% less stiff and 40% droopier. Moreover, calcification was not a linear proxy for mechanical performance; stem stiffness decreased exponentially with reduced calcification. Although calcifying organisms can tolerate high CO2 conditions, even subtle changes in calcification can cause dramatic changes in skeletal performance, which may in turn affect key biotic and abiotic interactions. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

A thorough calcareous nannofossil semi-quantitative analysis was performed to determine the biostratigraphic assignment of the deep-seated source strata. Mudstone/shale clasts of different stratigraphic levels were identified and assigned to the Miocene nannofossil biozones CNM10, CNM8–9, CNM7, CNM6–7, and Oli-gocene CNO4/CNO5. A single mudstone clast from the Gelendzhik plateau, assigned to the bi-ozone CNM10, demonstrated unique micropaleontological and geochemical characteristics, sug-gesting a sapropelic origin. Subsequently, the total organic carbon (TOC) content and thermal maturity of the collected mud breccias was evaluated using the Rock-Eval pyrolysis technique, and their oil and gas potential was estimated. The pyrolyzed sediments were both organic rich and organic poor (TOC >0.5% or <0.5%, respectively), with their organic matter showing characteristics of the type III kerogen that consists of adequate hydrogen to be gas generative, but insufficient hydrogen to be oil prone. However, the organic matter of the late Serravallian (CNM10) sapropelic mudstone was found to consist of a mixed type II/III kerogen, implying an oil-prone source rock. © 2021 by the authors.

This area lies within the Cyclades back-arc region of the present Hellenic subduction zone where the seafloor of the eastern Mediterranean Sea is descending beneath the Aegean microplate. The Cycladic region and the Aegean Sea as a whole are known to be regions of north-south back-arc extension and thinning of continental crust. Nineteen submarine volcanic cones occur within this small rift zone, the largest of these being Kolumbo which last erupted explosively in 1650. AD, causing significant damage and fatalities on the nearby island of Santorini. Previous SEABEAM mapping and seismic studies from HCMR indicate that many of the smaller v'olcanic cones have been built above the present seafloor, while others are partly buried, indicating a range of ages for the activity along this volcanic line. None of the cones to the northeast of Kolumbo had been explored in detail prior to a cruise of the E/V Nautilus (NA007) in August 2010. The ROV Hercules was used to explore the slopes, summits and craters of 17 of the 19 centers identified on multibeam maps of the area. Water depths of the submarine volcano's summits ranged from 18 to 450. m. In general, the domes/craters northeast of Kolumbo were sediment covered and showed little evidence of recent volcanic activity. Outcrops of volcanic rock were found in the crater walls and slopes of some of the cones but they typically consisted of volcanic fragments of pumice and lava that have been cemented together by biological activity, indicative of the lack of recent eruptions. Geochemical analysis of samples collected on the northeast cones showed evidence of low temperature hydrothermal circulation on the summit and upper flanks in the form of stream-like manganese precipitates emanating from pits and fractures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Kolumbo Volcano; Offshore morphotectonics; ROV exploration; Volcanic hazard,Aegean sea; Back-arc; Continental crusts; Crater wall; Cyclades; Eastern Mediterranean sea; Geochemical analysis; Hellenic subduction zone; Hydrothermal circulation; Low temperatures; Microplates; Morphotectonics; Multi-beam; Rift zones; Sea floor; Seismic studies; Submarine volcanism; Submarine volcano; Volcanic activities; Volcanic cones; Volcanic hazards; Volcanic zone; Water depth; Analytical geochemistry; Bioactivity; Manganese; Structural geology; Submarines; Tectonics; Volcanoes; bioactivity; continental crust; low temperature; remotely operated vehicle; seafloor; slope; submarine volcano; tectonics; volcanic eruption; volcanism; water depth; Aegean Sea; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Santorini [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Nautilus,Article,Scopus,Kolumbo,36.525,25.4833,495,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Chemosynthetic communities were observed and sampled on six mud volcanoes and along a fault scarp.

These mats were interspersed with one another, but their underlying sediment biogeochemistries differed considerably. Microscopy revealed that the white mats were granules composed of elemental S filaments, similar to those produced by the sulfide-oxidizing epsilonproteobacterium ""Candidatus Arcobacter sulfidicus."" Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that microorganisms targeted by a ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus""-specific oligonucleotide probe constituted up to 24% of the total the cells within these mats. Several 16S rRNA gene sequences from organisms closely related to ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" were identified. In contrast, the orange mat consisted mostly of bright orange flakes composed of empty Fe(III) (hydr)oxide-coated microbial sheaths, similar to those produced by the neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing betaproteobacterium Leptothrix ochracea. None of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from these samples were closely related to sequences of known neutrophilic aerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. The sediments below both types of mats showed relatively high sulfate reduction rates (300 nmol · cm-3 · day-1) partially fueled by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (10 to 20 nmol · cm-3 · day -1). Free sulfide produced below the white mat was depleted by sulfide oxidation within the mat itself. Below the orange mat free Fe(II) reached the surface layer and was depleted in part by microbial Fe(II) oxidation. Both mats and the sediments underneath them hosted very diverse microbial communities and contained mineral precipitates, most likely due to differences in fluid flow patterns.

A total of 339 and 526 sequences were retrieved, corresponding to 25 and 213 unique (=98% similarity) phylotypes of Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, in all depths. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index H was higher for Bacteria (1. 92-4. 03) than for Archaea (0. 99-1. 91) and varied differently between the two groups. Archaea were dominated by anaerobic methanotrophs ANME-1, -2 and -3 groups and were related to phylotypes involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane from similar habitats. The much more complex Bacteria community consisted of 20 phylogenetic groups at the phylum/candidate division level. Proteobacteria, in particular d-Proteobacteria, was the dominant group. In most sediment layers, the dominant phylotypes of both the Archaea and Bacteria communities were found in neighbouring layers, suggesting some overlap in species richness. The similarity of certain prokaryotic communities was also depicted by using four different similarity indices. The direct comparison of the retrieved phylotypes with those from the Kazan mud volcano of the same field revealed that 40. 0% of the Archaea and 16. 9% of the Bacteria phylotypes are common between the two systems. The majority of these phylotypes are closely related to phylotypes originating from other mud volcanoes, implying a degree of endemicity in these systems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; RNA 16S; sea water; archaebacterium; article; bacterium; biodiversity; chemistry; DNA sequence; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; Mediterranean Sea; microbiology; phylogeny; sediment; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Mediterranean Sea; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Microbiology; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Deltaproteobacteria; Prokaryota; Proteobacteria",Article,Scopus,Amsterdam,35.33467,30.26885,2028,Mud Volcano,Turkey,methane,Anaximander Mountains,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

A total of 242 archaeal and 374 bacterial clones were analysed, which were attributed to 38 and 205 unique phylotypes, respectively (=98% similarity). Most of the archaeal phylotypes were related to ANME-1, -2 and -3 members originating from habitats where anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurs, although they occurred in sediment layers with no apparent AOM (below the sulphate depletion depth). Proteobacteria were the most abundant and diverse bacterial group, with the Gammaproteobacteria dominating in most sediment layers and these were related to phylotypes involved in methane cycling. The Deltaproteobacteria included several of the sulphate-reducers related to AOM. The rest of the bacterial phylotypes belonged to 15 known phyla and three unaffiliated groups, with representatives from similar habitats. Diversity index H was in the range 0.56-1.73 and 1.47-3.82 for Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, revealing different depth patterns for the two groups.

Moreover, the evaluation of the eruptive sediment's thermal maturity may provide solid documentation of the petroleum generation potential in high depths below seafloor (bsf). Hence, the present study, through the integration of sedimentary facies analysis with hydrocarbon biomarker analysis (based on the concentrations of long-chain (C25–C35) n-alkanes, hopanes and steranes), supported by swath bathymetry data, examined five sediment cores recovered from the Gelendzhik, Moscow, Milano, Leipzig and Heraklion MVs of the Olimpi mud volcano field (OMVF) on the central Mediterranean Ridge. The main objective of this investigation was to assess the ‘modern’ eruptive activity in the OMVF and identify the mud breccia's origin and mobilization depth (based on its maturity level), and the ages of the source beds. Among the studied MVs, Milano, Leipzig and Heraklion appear ‘recently’ active, while Moscow perhaps remains in dormancy for at least one century. The eruptive activity in the OMVF seems to be, generally, vigorous and persistent, while it is linked with several source beds of variable stratigraphy or environmental condition. The multiple eruptive episodes, occurring as uninterrupted events or via pulses, create conditions that perhaps favour high releases of methane into the water column as well as the growth of the gas hydrate phase near the seafloor.

This event represents a unique opportunity to study benthic foraminiferal assemblages under the ecological stress of hydrothermal emissions in shallow (10-15 m water depth) environments. Benthic foraminifera (&gt;63 µm) were collected by a scuba diver from sediments and seagrass of a Posidonia oceanica meadow off the coast of Panarea. Assemblages were studied to assess mortality and monitor the composition of benthic communities following the sudden venting event, characterized by an intensification of the emission of gases with high temperatures (40-50°C), low pH (~5), and high concentrations of HCl, HF, SO2 and some H2S. Surface foraminiferal assemblages were monitored during surveys on November 13-14, 2002, and May 22-24, 2003. In November 2002 (10 days after the venting event) agglutinated forms dominated the assemblages in sediment samples, whereas hyaline forms dominated the assemblages collected from the leaves and roots of P. oceanica. Six months later, in May 2003, when environmental conditions had returned to normal, sediment samples were barren of foraminifera, whereas the assemblages associated with P. oceanica were composed of allogromiids, which can be considered opportunistic pioneer species able to colonize disturbed environments.",NA,benthic foraminifera; hydrothermal vent; Aeolian Arc; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea; Allogromiidae; Foraminifera; Halophila; Posidonia oceanica,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.5568,15.1097,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Aeolian Arc,biological,,meiofauna,Foraminifera,,survival

Active hydrothermal spots were distinguished from the surrounding sediments by direct observations by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and subsequent seafloor sampling. Samples were taken at different water depths and are characterized by a number of mineralogies reflecting the changing temperature of the hydrothermal fluids. Overall, benthic foraminifera are absent from sites with high-temperature hydrothermal emissions, and their distribution at sites of low-temperature emissions is very patchy, depending on the physical and/or chemical conditions reflecting differences in temperature and composition of the emitted fluids. In the Secca del Capo area, which is free from recent emission activity, the benthic foraminiferal population is indicative of a normal marine environment, with Globocassidulina subglobosa, Cassidulina crassa, and Gavelinopsis lobatulus. In the Basiluzzo, Secca dei Pesci, and Panarea areas, which are characterized by different degrees of hydrothermal activity, three distinct assemblages have been recognized. The first assemblage is dominated by Ammodiscus catinus, Glomospira charoides, and Glomospira gordialis and indicates hydrothermal influence. The second assemblage, with Lobatula lobatula, Asterigerinata mamilla, Rosalina globularis, and Quinqueloculina spp. as main constituents, indicates a seagrass environment influenced by diffuse emissions. The third assemblage with abundant A. catinus, Ammoglobigerina globigeriniformis, G. gordialis and Haplophragmoides canariensis suggests low pH conditions resulting from acidic hydrothermal emissions, leading to the dissolution of calcium carbonate tests. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-five species (2 Calcarea and 23 Demospongiae) were found, few compared with the 589 recorded for the Mediterranean, but an important addition to the scant information on the sponge fauna of the Aegean Sea. The number of species found at vent sites was consistently higher than that found at non-vent sites, but no vent-obligate species could be identified. However, Geodia cydonium and three species of Cliona (C. copiosa, C. nigricans and C. rhodensis) showed a tendency to colonize vent areas. The former might take advantage of increased silica availability, the latter of the enhanced deposition of carbonates near vents. Substratum cover by sponges (estimated from wire-framed photographs of 0.7 m(2)), varied greatly both among and within sites, mostly according to slope. Most sponge species preferred vertical to overhanging, shaded substrata. Proximity to vents seemed to have little or no influence on sponge cover, notwithstanding a primary effect on species diversity.

Pressure coring (the only technique preventing hydrates from decomposition during recovery) was used for the quantification of light hydrocarbons in near-surface deposits. The cores (up to 2.5 m in length) were retrieved with an autoclave piston corer, and served for analyses of gas quantities and compositions, and pore-water chemistry. For comparison, gravity cores from sites at the summit and beyond the AMV were analyzed. A prevalence of thermogenic light hydrocarbons was inferred from average C1/C2+ ratios &lt;35 and d13C-CH4 values of -50.6‰. Gas venting from the seafloor indicated methane oversaturation, and volumetric gas-sediment ratios of up to 17.0 in pressure cores taken from the center demonstrated hydrate presence at the time of sampling. Relative enrichments in ethane, propane, and iso-butane in gas released from pressure cores, and from an intact hydrate piece compared to venting gas suggest incipient crystallization of hydrate structure II (sII). Nonetheless, the co-existence of sI hydrate can not be excluded from our dataset. Hydrates fill up to 16.7% of pore volume within the sediment interval between the base of the sulfate zone and the maximum sampling depth at the summit. The concave-down shapes of pore-water concentration profiles recorded in the center indicate the influence of upward-directed advection of low-salinity fluids/fluidized mud. Furthermore, the SO42- and Ba2+ pore-water profiles in the central part of the AMV demonstrate that sulfate reduction driven by the anaerobic oxidation of methane is complete at depths between 30 cm and 70 cm below seafloor. Our results indicate that methane oversaturation, high hydrostatic pressure, and elevated pore-water activity caused by low salinity promote fixing of considerable proportions of light hydrocarbons in shallow hydrates even at the summit of the AMV, and possibly also of other MVs in the region. Depending on their crystallographic structure, however, hydrates will already decompose and release hydrocarbon masses if sediment temperatures exceed ca. 19.3°C and 21.0°C, respectively. Based on observations from other mud volcanoes, the common occurrence of such temperatures induced by heat flux from below into the immediate subsurface appears likely for the AMV. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",NA,Amsterdam; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Anaximander mountains; Co-existence; Crystallographic structure; Data sets; Eastern Mediterranean sea; Gas venting; Gravity core; High hydrostatic pressure; Hydrate structures; In-situ; Isobutanes; Light hydrocarbon; Low salinity; Mediterranean sea; Mud volcanoes; Near-surface; Oversaturation; Pore volume; Pore waters; Pore-water chemistry; Sea floor; Sulfate reduction; Transport mechanism; Water depth; Barium; Butane; Deposits; Ethane; Gases; Hydration; Hydrostatic pressure; Liquefied petroleum gas; Metallic glass; Methane; Organic compounds; Propane; Salinity measurement; Sedimentology; Sediments; Volcanoes; Gas hydrates; concentration (composition); crystallization; decomposition; gas hydrate; heat flux; hydrostatic pressure; methane; mud volcano; oxidation; porewater; salinity; seafloor; supersaturation; venting; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northeast),Article,Scopus,Amsterdam,35.33467,30.26885,2028,Mud Volcano,Turkey,methane,Anaximander Mountains,environmental,,,,,

Cells were Gram-stain-negative curved rods with one or more polar flagella. Cells were approximately 1–1.5 µm in length and 0.6 µm in width. Strain TC8T grew between 20 and 35 °C (optimum 30 °C), with between 5 and 45 g NaCl l-1 (optimum 15–20 g l-1) and between pH 4.5 and 8.5 (optimum pH 6.0–7.0). The generation time under optimal conditions was 8 h. Strain TC8T was a facultative chemolithoautotroph also capable of using organic substrates as electron donors and carbon sources. Chemolithoautotrophic growth occurred with sulfur and thiosulfate as the electron donors, CO2 as the carbon source, and nitrate, oxygen (5 %, v/v) and ferric iron as the electron acceptors. Chemoorganoheterotrophic growth occurred with tryptone, peptone, Casamino acids, pyruvate and glycerol as substrates, while chemolithoherotrophic growth occurred with D(+)-glucose, sucrose, yeast extract, acetate, lactate, citrate and L-glutamine. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 59.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain TC8T showed that this organism formed a lineage within the family Rhodospirillaceae, which branched separately from the two closest relatives, Magnetovibrio blakemorei MV1T (91.25% similarity) and Magnetospira thiophila MMS-1T (90.13 %). Based on phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, it is proposed that the organism represents a novel species of a new genus within the family Rhodospirillaceae, Varunaivibrio sulfuroxidans gen. nov., sp. nov.

At Tor Caldara, filamentous microbial biofilms, mainly composed of Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria, grow on substrates exposed to the gas venting. In this study, we took a metaproteogenomic approach to identify the metabolic potential and in situ expression of central metabolic pathways at two stages of biofilm maturation. Our findings indicate that inorganic reduced sulfur species are the main electron donors and CO2 the main carbon source for the filamentous biofilms, which conserve energy by oxygen and nitrate respiration, fix dinitrogen gas and detoxify heavy metals. Three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representative of key members in the biofilm community, were also recovered. Metaproteomic data show that metabolically active chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing members of the Epsilonproteobacteria dominated the young microbial biofilms, while Gammaproteobacteria become prevalent in the established community. The co-expression of different pathways for sulfide oxidation by these two classes of bacteria suggests exposure to different sulfide concentrations within the biofilms, as well as fine-tuned adaptations of the enzymatic complexes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a shift in the taxonomic composition and associated metabolic activity of these biofilms in the course of the colonization process.",shallow-water gas vent; Tor Caldara; microbial biofilms; metaproteome; metagenome; metabolic profile; Epsilonproteobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria,NA,Article,WOS,Tor Caldara,41.485833,12.589722,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,H2S-CO2,Tyrrhenian,biological,,bacteria,microbial community,,survival

Hydrothermal fluids were collected by scuba diving in active shallow hydrothermal venting areas on Kos Island in the Aegean Sea in East Mediterranean. Analysis was carried out in suspended particles for Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ca, Ba, Sr, Li, Al and Si. During sampling, gas and water flux was measured and gas/water ratios were estimated. The data presented significant time and spatial variability. The gas flux values in Kephalos Bay varied from 2 to 126 L/h and water flux varied from 60 to 122 L/h. In Bros Thermi the gas flux values varied from 4.5 to 60 L/h and the water flux was found to be from 16.5 to 96 L/h. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) flux varied from 0.93 to 8.64 mg/L and between 0.21 and 20.94 mg/L respectively at two sites studied. Metal/Al ratios also varied significantly within a short distance. The pH of hydrothermal waters was from 5.50 to 5.95 in Kephalos Bay and from 6.09 to 6.53 in Bros Thermi suggesting either different mixing of fluids with seawater deeper in the substrate or perhaps that gases CO2 and H2S control pH values. The main scope of this research is to evaluate the fluxes of gas and water and study the main particulate geochemistry of hydrothermal venting fluids. Hydrothermal particles from the submarine vents studied were dominated by Fe, Ca, Si and Al and strongly enriched in Mn, Cu, Pb and Ba. Based on Metal/Al ratios, it is suggested that there are two distinct hydrothermal reservoirs in Kos. The chemistry of the particles emitted from seeps strongly influence both the marine sediment geochemistry and element distribution locally on the sea bottom while subjected to further transportation, hydrothermal particulates could also affect a much greater region. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Aegean Sea; basic metals; East Mediterranean; Hellenic Volcanic Arc; hydrothermal vents; Kos Island; particulate matter,Aluminum; Gases; Hydrogen sulfide removal (water treatment); Particles (particulate matter); Silicon; Submarine geology; Submarines; Element distribution; Hydrothermal activity; Hydrothermal fluids; Hydrothermal water; Marine sediments; Spatial variability; Suspended particles; Suspended particulate matters; Hydrochemistry; geochemistry; hydrothermal activity; hydrothermal deposit; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal vent; particulate matter; sediment chemistry; Dodecanese; Greece; Hellenic Arc; Kos [Dodecanese]; Kos [Southern Aegean]; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Southern Aegean,Article,Scopus,Kos,36.837555,27.318081,20,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

The longest continuous drill core recovered consists of 4.84 m of massive to semimassive barite and sulfides with abundant late, native sulfur overprint. Seafloor observations suggest that the hydrothermal system associated with the formation of the subseafloor barite and sulfide ore zone is still active, although black smoker activity does not occur on the seafloor.Laser ablation and conventional sulfur isotope analyses show that pyrite formed close to the seafloor within the zone of polymetallic metal enrichment has a variable sulfur isotope composition (d34S =-39 to +3‰), whereas a more narrow range is observed in the massive pyrite at depth (d34S =-10 to 0‰). Similar variations were also documented for the late native sulfur overprint. Overall, the negative sulfur isotope ratios at depth, the intermediate-to very high sulfidation conditions during mineralization, and the abundance of native sulfur suggest contributions of magmatic volatiles to the mineralizing fluids from a degassing magma chamber at depth. Biological processes are interpreted to have played a major role during late stages of ore formation.The combination of a subseafloor replacement deposit with a massive to semimassive barite cap rock overlying massive pyrite, the intermediate-to high-sulfidation characteristics, and the strong biological influence on the late stages of mineralization are distinct from other modern seafloor massive sulfide deposits and represents a style of submarine mineralization not previously recognized in a modern volcanic arc environment. The barite and sulfide occurrence at Palinuro shares many characteristics with porphyry-related base metal veins and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits, suggesting that metallogenic processes associated with arcrelated magmatic-hydrothermal systems are not restricted to the subaerial environment.The recovered drill core shows that the subseafloor deposit is zoned with depth. The top of the mineralized zone is comprised of a variably silicified vuggy barite-sulfide facies that shows notable polymetallic metal enrichment, while the deeper portion of the mineralized zone is dominated by massive pyrite having distinctly lower base and precious metal grades. Metal zonation of the barite and sulfide deposit is related to the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids in space and time. The barite cap and the massive pyrite present in the deeper portion of the mineralized zone appear to have formed early in the paragenesis. During the main stage of the mineralization, the barite cap was brecciated and cemented by a polymetallic assemblage of barite and pyrite with minor chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite, trace famatinite, and rare cinnabar. Lower temperature precipitates formed during the main stage of mineralization include sphalerite, galena, pyrite, opal-A, and barite, which are associated with traces of Pb-Sb-As sulfosalts such as bournonite-seligmannite, or semseyite. A distinct mineral assemblage of fine-grained anhedral enargite, hypogene covellite, chalcopyrite, and galena is commonly associated with colloform sphalerite, galena, and pyrite as a late phase of this main stage. Colloform pyrite and marcasite are the last sulfides formed in the paragenetic sequence. The deposit is interpreted to have formed from fluids having an intermediate-sulfidation state, although excursions to high-and very high sulfidation states are indicated by the presence of abundant enargite and hypogene covellite. © 2014 by Economic Geology.",NA,Barite; Biology; Core drilling; Deposits; Drills; Economic geology; Isotopes; Laser ablation; Metals; Pyrites; Sulfide minerals; Sulfur; Sulfur deposits; Underwater mineral resources; Volcanoes; Zinc sulfide; Biological influences; Epithermal deposits; Hydrothermal fluids; Hydrothermal system; Lower temperatures; Magmatic-hydrothermal systems; Mineralizing fluids; Seafloor massive sulfides; Mineralogy; drilling; economic geology; eolian deposit; hydrothermal system; massive sulfide; seafloor; sulfur; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Palinuro,39.55,14.7,630,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

During the Medeco2 cruise in fall 2007, ROV dives enabled detailed sampling of the brine fluid, bottom lake sediments at ca. 450 m lake depth, sub-surface sediments from the MV flanks, and carbonate crusts at the MV foot. Based on mineralogical, elemental and stable isotope analyses, this study aims at exploring the origin of the brine fluid and the key biogeochemical processes controlling the formation of these deep-sea authigenic carbonates. In addition to their patchy occurrence in crusts outcropping at the seafloor, authigenic carbonates occur as small concretions disseminated within sub-seafloor sediments, as well as in the bottom sediments and muddy brine of the crater lake. Aragonite and Mg-calcite dominate in the carbonate crusts and in sub-seafloor concretions at the MV foot, whereas Mg-calcite, dolomite and ankerite dominate in the muddy brine lake and in sub-seafloor concretions near the crater rim. The carbonate crusts and sub-seafloor concretions at the MV foot precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with bottom seawater temperature; their low d13C values (-42.6 to -24.5‰) indicate that anaerobic oxidation of methane was the main driver of carbonate precipitation. By contrast, carbonates from the muddy lake brine, bottom lake concretions and crater rim concretions display much higher d13C (up to -5.2‰) and low d18O values (down to -2.8‰); this is consistent with their formation in warm fluids of deep origin characterized by 13C-rich CO2 and, as confirmed by independent evidence, slightly higher heavy rare earth element signatures, the main driver of carbonate precipitation being methanogenesis. Moreover, the benthic activity within the seafloor sediment enhances aerobic oxidation of methane and of sulphide that promotes carbonate dissolution and gypsum precipitation. These findings imply that the coupling of carbon and sulphur microbial reactions represents the major link for the transfer of elements and for carbon isotope fractionation between fluids and authigenic minerals. A new challenge awaiting future studies in cold seep environments is to expand this work to oxidized and reduced sulphur authigenic minerals. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,Brines; Calcite; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Carbonation; Isotopes; Lakes; Methane; Oxidation; Sediments; Sulfur; Volcanoes; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Authigenic carbonates; Biogeochemical process; Carbon isotope fractionation; Carbonate precipitation; Eastern Mediterranean sea; Heavy rare earth elements; Stable-isotope analysis; Underwater mineral resources; biogeochemistry; brine; caldera; carbon isotope; carbonate; cold seep; crater lake; isotopic fractionation; marine sediment; methane; mud volcano; passive margin; seepage; submarine fan; sulfur; Mediterranean Sea; Gorgonacea,Article,Scopus,Cheops,32.14142,28.1619,3020,Mud Volcano,Egypt,,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,environmental,,,,,

They are considered a vulnerable group to ocean acidification due to the potential dissolution of their high-Mg calcite skeleton at lower pH. Nevertheless, different species of coralline algae showed different responses to low-pH/high-pCO(2) environment. Here, we studied the physiological response of Jania rubens to the pH condition predicted for the year 2100. We used a natural CO2 vent system as natural laboratory to transplant J. rubens from pH 8.1-7.5 for 3 weeks. Maximal PSII photochemical efficiency showed a significant reduction in transplanted thalli at low pH (7.5-T) compared to other conditions; consistent with that result, also the pigments involved in the light-harvesting spectrum of J. rubens (i.e., chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobilins), exhibited a significant decrease under water acidification, highlighting the strong sensitivity of this species to the environmental change. A major understanding of the response of coralline algae at high CO2 will go through the impact of OA on benthic ecosystems in the next future.

Samples of consumers and potential organic matter sources (macroalgae, seagrass and epiphytes) were collected in two periods (May-June and Oct-Nov 2012) in two acidified areas (Castello Aragonese CO2 vents, off Ischia, Italy) and in two control areas. Results suggest a substantial effect of high pCO2 on isotopic composition of both organic matter sources and consumers. The recurring 13C depletion observed in the acidified sites is probably due to an increase in carbon availability and to the exploitation of volcanic-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) present in the area. The nutritional quality of organic matter sources was higher in low pH stations, where indeed C:N ratios decreased. Despite the occurrence of these effects, the trophic habit of high pCO2 tolerant polychaete consumers seems not to be dramatically affected. Our findings shed the light on how some benthic organisms may respond well to near-future OA conditions, exhibiting high plasticity also in their feeding habits, without being subject to dramatic ecological changes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon; Climate change; Macroalgae; Nitrogen; Ocean acidification; PH; Posidonia oceanica,acidification; benthos; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; dissolved inorganic carbon; isotopic composition; macroalga; marine environment; nitrogen isotope; pH; pollution effect; polychaete; stable isotope; trophic interaction; Mediterranean Sea; Nereididae; Opheliidae; Platynereis dumerilii; Polychaeta; Polyophthalmus pictus; Posidonia oceanica; Syllidae; Typosyllis variegata,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,Polychaeta,,survival

These mussels, here referred to as Idas-like nov. sp., differ morphologically and genetically from another species identified as Idas aff. modiolaeformis, living in the same type of ecosystem in the Nile Deep-Sea Fan (eastern Mediterranean Sea). A phylogenetic analysis confirms the distinction between the two species, which belong to highly divergent lineages. Carbon stable isotope values, as well as the detection of thiotroph-related bacteria in the gill tissue, support the presence of a symbiotic, thiotroph-derived nutrition.

Here, we report on the geochemistry of high-temperature fluids (up to 220 degrees C) venting at 500 m b.s.l. from the floor of Kolumbo submarine volcano (Hellenic Volcanic Arc, Greece), which is located 7 km northeast of Santorini Island. Despite the recent unrest at Santorini, Kolumbo submarine volcano is considered more active due to a higher seismicity. Rizzo et al. (2016) investigated the He-isotope composition of gases collected from seven chimneys and showed that are dominated by CO2 (> 97%), with only a small air contamination. Here we provide more-complete chemical data and isotopic compositions of CO2 and CH4, and Hg(O) concentration. We show that the gases emitted from different vents are fractionated by the partial dissolution of CO2 in water. Fractionation is also evident in the C-isotope composition (delta C-13(CO2)), which varies between -0.04 and 1.15 parts per thousand. We modeled this process to reconstruct the chemistry and delta C-13(CO2) of intact magmatic gases before fractionation. We argue that the CO2 prior to CO2 dissolution in water had delta C-13 similar to-0.4 h and CO2/He-3 similar to 1 x 10(10). This model reveals that the gases emitted from Kolumbo originate from a homogeneous mantle contaminated with CO2, probably due to decarbonation of subducting limestone, which is similar to other Mediterranean arc volcanoes (e.g., Stromboli, Italy). The isotopic signature of CH4 (delta C-13 similar to -18 h and delta D similar to -117 parts per thousand) is within a range of values typically observed for hydrothermal gases (e.g., Panarea and Campi Flegrei, Italy), which is suggestive of mixing between thermogenic and abiotic CH4. We report that the concentrations of Hg(O) in Kolumbo fluids are particularly high (similar to 61 to 1300 ng m(-3)) when compared to land-based fumaroles located on Santorini and worldwide aerial volcanic emissions. This finding may represent further evidence for the high level of magmatic activity at Kolumbo. Based on the geo-indicators of temperature and pressure, we calculate that the magmatic gases equilibrate within the Kolumbo hydrothermal system at about 270 degrees C and at a depth of similar to 1 km b.s.l.",Hellenic Volcanic Arc; Kolumbo submarine volcano; submarine gases; gas-water interaction; hydrothermal system; CO2; CH4,PANAREA AEOLIAN ISLANDS; AEGEAN SEA; HYDROTHERMAL FLUIDS; VULCANO-ISLAND; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; MERCURY EMISSIONS; SANTORINI VOLCANO; ACTIVE TECTONICS; MAGMATIC FLUIDS; NOBLE-GASES,Article,WOS,Kolumbo,36.525,25.4833,495,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Here we report the first coastal transplant experiment designed to investigate the effects of naturally acidified seawater on the rates of net calcification and dissolution of the branched calcitic bryozoan Myriapora truncata (Pallas, 1766). Colonies were transplanted to normal (pH 8.1), high (mean pH 7.66, minimum value 7.33) and extremely high CO2 conditions (mean pH 7.43, minimum value 6.83) at gas vents off Ischia Island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). The net calcification rates of live colonies and the dissolution rates of dead colonies were estimated by weighing after 45 days (May-June 2008) and after 128 days (July-October) to examine the hypothesis that high CO2 levels affect bryozoan growth and survival differently during moderate and warm water conditions. In the first observation period, seawater temperatures ranged from 19 to 24 °C; dead M. truncata colonies dissolved at high CO2 levels (pH 7.66), whereas live specimens maintained the same net calcification rate as those growing at normal pH. In extremely high CO2 conditions (mean pH 7.43), the live bryozoans calcified significantly less than those at normal pH. Therefore, established colonies of M. truncata seem well able to withstand the levels of ocean acidification predicted in the next 200 years, possibly because the soft tissues protect the skeleton from an external decrease in pH. However, during the second period of observation a prolonged period of high seawater temperatures (25-28 °C) halted calcification both in controls and at high CO2, and all transplants died when high temperatures were combined with extremely high CO2 levels. Clearly, attempts to predict the future response of organisms to ocean acidification need to consider the effects of concurrent changes such as the Mediterranean trend for increased summer temperatures in surface waters. Although M. truncata was resilient to short-term exposure to high levels of ocean acidification at normal temperatures, our field transplants showed that its ability to calcify at higher temperatures was compromised, adding it to the growing list of species now potentially threatened by global warming. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Bryozoan; Calcification; Global warming; Mediterranean Sea; Myriapora truncata; Ocean acidification; Volcanic CO2 vents,acidification; bryozoan; calcification; carbon dioxide; dissolution; experimental study; global warming; growth response; high temperature; hydrothermal vent community; marine ecosystem; sea surface temperature; seawater; survival; temperature effect; Campania [Italy]; Ischia; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Napoli [Campania]; Tyrrhenian Sea; Bryozoa,Article,Scopus,Ischia,40.7306,13.95,3,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Neapolitan,biological,,macrobenthos,Bryozoa,Myriapora truncata,calcification

There are concerns that cold-water corals are even more vulnerable as they live in areas where aragonite saturation (Oara) is lower than in the tropics and is falling rapidly due to CO2 emissions. Here, we provide laboratory evidence that net (gross calcification minus dissolution) and gross calcification rates of three common cold-water corals, Caryophyllia smithii, Dendrophyllia cornigera, and Desmophyllum dianthus, are not affected by pCO2 levels expected for 2100 (pCO2 1058 µatm, Oara 1.29), and nor are the rates of skeletal dissolution in D. dianthus.

During a high-resolution ship-based multibeam survey covering a ~225km2 large seafloor area in the Central Province of the NDSF we identified 163 high-backscatter patches at water depths between 1500 and 1800m, and investigated the source, composition, turnover, flux and fate of emitted hydrocarbons. Systematic Parasound single beam echosounder surveys of the water column showed hydroacoustic anomalies (flares), indicative of gas bubble streams, above 8% of the high-backscatter patches. In echosounder records flares disappeared in the water column close to the upper limit of the gas hydrate stability zone located at about 1350m water depth due to decomposition of gas hydrate skins and subsequent gas dissolution. Visual inspection of three high-backscatter patches demonstrated that sediment cementation has led to the formation of continuous flat pavements of authigenic carbonates typically 100 to 300m in diameter. Volume estimates, considering results from high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based multibeam mapping, were used to calculate the amount of carbonate-bound carbon stored in these slabs. Additionally, the flux of methane bubbles emitted at one high-backscatter patch was estimated (0.23 to 2.3×106mola-1) by combined AUV flare mapping with visual observations by remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Another high-backscatter patch characterized by single carbonate pieces, which were widely distributed and interspaced with sediments inhabited by thiotrophic, chemosynthetic organisms, was investigated using in situ measurements with a benthic chamber and ex situ sediment core incubation and allowed for estimates of the methane consumption (0.1 to 1×106mola-1) and dissolved methane flux (2 to 48×106mola-1). Our comparison of dissolved and gaseous methane fluxes as well as methane-derived carbonate reservoirs demonstrates the need for quantitative assessment of these different methane escape routes and their interaction with the geo-, bio-, and hydrosphere at cold seeps. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Authigenic carbonates; Autonomous underwater vehicle; Carbon budgets; Deep-water hydrocarbon seepage; Gas flares; High-resolution multibeam mapping,Autonomous vehicles; Backscattering; Budget control; Carbonates; Carbonation; Gas hydrates; Gases; Hydration; Hydrocarbon seepage; Hydrocarbons; Mapping; Methane; Remotely operated vehicles; Sediments; Surveys; Authigenic carbonates; Carbon budgets; Deep Water; Gas flares; Multibeam mappings; Autonomous underwater vehicles; authigenic mineral; autonomous underwater vehicle; backscatter; carbon budget; gas flow; gas hydrate; methane; remotely operated vehicle; seafloor; seepage; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Gorgonacea,Article,Scopus,Central Province,32.533056,30.3525,1800,Pockmarks,Egypt,methane,Nile Deep-Sea Fan,environmental,,,,,

The mud volcanoes, characterized by a high backscatter signature, are the site of gas venting at the seafloor that formed a 630-m-high plume in the water column. The mud volcanoes feature a precipitation of iron-oxy-hydroxide crusts and pyritized and Sulfur burrows in the sub-surface and authigenic siderites, also cementing burrows, further down, showing a sharp transition from the oxic zone toward the sulfate-methanogenic zone.The mud flows are characterized by an intermediate backscatter seafloor and by the presence of gas in the sediment only 2. m below the seafloor. The mud flows consist of 1-m-thick drapes of water-rich mud extending downslope from the mud volcanoes. They act as sealing layers that prevent large fluxes of gas venting at the seafloor (low venting) and favor oxic conditions close to the sediment-water interface and the abundant precipitation of post-oxic siderites a few meters below the seafloor.The mud diapirs are characterized by a low backscatter seafloor and large fields of pockmarks. In coincidence with the normal faults, organogenic carbonate crusts form at or very close to the seafloor and are associated with chemosymbiontic bivalves (lucinids). The youngest shells are AMS radiocarbon dated 640-440.

The results, coupled with the interpretation of the seafloor backscatter, constrained both the biogeochemical zonation and the spatial distribution of the cold seep habitats in the area. These have proved to change in depth in a range of few meters and laterally within narrow zones. The mud volcanoes, characterized by a high backscatter signature, are the site of vigorous gas venting and, in the subsurface, show a rapid transition from the oxic sea water interface toward the methane-sulfate transition zone in the sediments. Intermediate backscatter typifies areas where free venting is hampered by the presence of mudflows at the seafloor. These conditions favor: i) the oxidation of sulfides near the seafloor, ii) the precipitation of siderites a few meters below the seafloor and iii) the formation of sulfides deeper in the sub-seafloor. Faults are likely candidates to act as conduits for sulfates and metal oxides that juxtapose different redox environments. Siderites precipitated in the fast and low venting sites showed enrichment in d13C and d18O, which are compatible with their precipitation in the methanogenic zone. The heavy-oxygen isotopic compositions of the siderites are possibly related to the dissociation of gas hydrates, which have not been mapped so far by seismic data in the study area. Mud diapirism is characterized by low backscatter seafloor, large fields of pockmarks and is dissected by normal faults. In coincidence with the normal faults, authigenic calcites and aragonites are present at or very close to the seafloor. They have the typical isotopic signature indicating formation during sulfate-dependent microbially-mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane. They are associated with Lucinoma borealis, the youngest being dated 640-440 BP. This suggests that the seepage activity in the mud diapirs was likely clogged by either carbonates or activity of the faults only very recently. © 2015 Società Geologica Italiana, Roma.",Lucinoma borealis; Pockmark; Siderite; Stable isotopes; Tyrrhenian Sea,authigenic mineral; backscatter; biogeochemistry; bivalve; cold seep; deep-sea sediment; diapir; habitat structure; mineralization; mud volcano; pockmark; seafloor mapping; siderite; spatial distribution; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Paola Ridge,39.1766,15.647,727,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Paola Basin,environmental,,,,,

The total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA) content was determined at eight stations, three located within the main hydrothermal depression (i.e. the Zannone Giant Pockmark, ZGP) and five located in the surrounding seafloor. THAA concentration ranged between ~2 and ~11 nmol mg-1 dw and the lowest THAA concentrations were found at stations located within the ZGP. Amino acids resistant to degradation or originating from bacteria (ß-alanine, histidine, leucine, arginine and lysine) had higher relative abundances inside the ZGP, whereas amino acids susceptible to degradation or originating from cellular plasma (proline, phenylalanine and tyrosine) showed higher relative abundances outside the ZGP. Degradation and reactivity indices were calculated, and the sedimentary organic matter in the three outside ZGP stations B07, B08 and B09 was found to be the most labile and reactive. Together with THAA concentrations, sediment grain size and carbon percentages were measured at 12 stations, five located within the ZGP and seven located outside the ZGP. At all stations, the percentage of sand was ~75% or higher. Carbon percentages were lower in samples located inside the ZGP than in the surrounding stations. The southern outside ZGP station B12 was found to be similar in terms of amino acids composition to the three inside ZGP stations, suggesting the influence of the hydrothermal fluids at this station. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Amino acids; Hydrothermal vent; Marine sediments,Biodegradation; Carbon; Hot springs; Sediments; Submarine geology; Amino acids compositions; Hydrothermal activity; Hydrothermal fluids; Hydrothermal vent; Marine sediments; Sediment grain size; Sedimentary organic matter; Western Mediterranean Sea; Amino acids; amino acid; bioindicator; concentration (composition); continental shelf; grain size; hydrothermal activity; hydrothermal system; organic matter; seafloor; sediment chemistry; shelf sediment; Italy; Latina; Lazio; Mediterranean Sea; Pontine Islands; Tyrrhenian Sea; Zannone,Article,Scopus,Zannone,40.972222,13.103056,150,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,,Pontine Archipelago,environmental,,,,,

The Scoglio d'Affrica seep has a gas composition typical of mud volcanoes, with methane as the prevalent component (95 vol%) and minor gases which include carbon dioxide, nitrogen and trace amounts of helium. The combined stable C and H isotope composition of CH4 (delta C-13 and delta H-2) and the enrichment in heavy carbon isotopes of CO2, highlight a prevalent secondary microbial origin for these fluids (delta C-13 similar to -35.8 parts per thousand vs VPDB; delta H-2 similar to-166 parts per thousand vs VSMOW; delta(13)C(CO2 )up to + 21.7 parts per thousand vs VPDB). Thus, in spite of the occurrence of positive magnetic anomalies, a possible abiotic origin of methane is excluded. Moreover, the gas from the mud volcano is extremely depleted in He-3 and presents typical He-3/He-4 ratios of a geological setting in which radiogenic crustal helium is strongly predominant. A photo-mosaic of the mud volcano is also reported. A possible connection with other submarine methane emissions in the Tuscan Archipelago is limited to emissions located few kilometers from the Scoglio d'Affrica area. Recent emissions in the area suggest that gases similar in composition from distinct reservoirs, find their way to the surface from Eocene deposits in different time intervals and through different faults and fractures, placed along the Elba-Pianosa ridge.",Submarine emission; Mud volcano; Methane; Gas geochemistry; Tyrrhenian sea,NATURAL-GAS; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; HELIUM-ISOTOPES; METHANE; CARBON; ORIGIN; ISLAND; ELBA; HYDROCARBONS; HYDROGEN,Article,WOS,Scoglio d'Affrica,42.375429,10.076685,12,Mud Volcano,Italy,methane,Elba Pianosa Ridge,environmental,,,,,

Origin and distribution of this gas have far reaching implications in microbiology, astrobiology and carbon cycle. We report an in-depth study of a recently described abiotic CH4 seep occurring in shallow seafloor along the western coast of Elba Island, Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy). The gas is characterized by stable C and H isotopic compositions of CH4 (d13C ~ -18‰; d2H ~ -141‰) and a very low CO2 content that are typical of abiotic gas in continental ultramafic rock systems. Based on local geothermal gradients, the temperature of methane production is estimated to be below 100 °C. The isotope signature of methane is similar to that occurring in the Liguria region, about 200 km north of Elba Island, where the same ophiolite unit exposed. A mantle CO2 component, suggested by relatively high 3He/4He ratios, has likely acted as CH4 precursor. The reconstruction of the geological-structural setting of Elba ophiolite sequence highlighted that the seep occurs in correspondence with a faulted reverse limb of the antiform of the ophiolite unit. The gas bearing fault forms a contact between mafic and ultramafic serpentinized rocks, as typically observed in other continental seeps and springs related to ophiolites. Magmatic intrusions in the island may have contributed to the C feedstock of methane. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Abiotic methane; Elba; Ophiolite; Serpentinization; Submarine seeps,Carbon dioxide; Gases; Isotopes; Lithology; Magnesite; Oil bearing formations; Submarines; Temperature; Elba; Geothermal gradients; Isotope signatures; Isotopic composition; Magmatic intrusions; Ophiolite; Serpentinization; Serpentinized peridotites; Methane; abiotic factor; carbon isotope; gas seepage; geothermal gradient; hydrogen isotope; isotopic composition; low temperature; mafic rock; methane; peridotite; seafloor; serpentinization; shallow water; ultramafic rock; underwater environment; Elba; Italy; Liguria; Livorno [Tuscany]; Mediterranean Sea; Tuscan Archipelago; Tuscany; Tyrrhenian Sea,Article,Scopus,Pomonte,42.7438,10.118635,12,Cold Seeps,Italy,methane,Tyrrhenian,environmental,,,,,

This study, conducted offthe Island of Ischia (Gulf of Naples, Italy), showed the presence of rich and well established populations through time, but only in a peculiar substratum (artificial collectors) and environment (low pH values).

The focus of the investigations was set on morphological, mineralogical, geochemical, and structural analyses. A broad variety of analytical methods was applied to gain as much information as possible. In addition to geological and sedimentological documentation and standard methods like making and analyzing thin and polished sections, optical microscopy or X-ray fluorescence analysis, the samples were investigated by X-ray computer tomography and scanning electron microscopy, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Because discharge features occur in various settings, a general classification of the features in the hydrothermal system was performed with special focus on their preservability in geological archives.

Marsili Seamount (MS) represents the axial ridge of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea back-arc basin, which is connected to the slab roll-backing processes affecting the Calabrian Arc (Italy). The Southern Tyrrhenian Sea back-arc is characterized by a significant decline in the spreading rate with time (2.8-3.1. mm/a to less than 1.8. mm/a in the last 0.78-1. Ma). MS develops between about 1. Ma and 3. ka and mainly consists of lava flows erupted from central and fissural vents. The MS products belong to the calcalkaline association and range in composition from basalts to trachytes. We present new stratigraphic, geochronological, and geochemical data (glass shards and minerals) of tephra from a 2.35. m long gravity core (Marsili1 core) recovered on MS at 943. m b.s.l. We recognize five tephras [M1 (top of the core) to M5 (bottom)] represented by poorly to highly vesiculated ashes. The lowermost tephra M5 emplaced between ca. 7 and 26. ka B.P.; it represents the less evolved distal counterpart of the Unit D related to the Biancavilla-Montalto products of Mount Etna (Sicily). The M1 to M4 tephras emplaced between 2.1 and 7.2. ka B.P. and are related to strombolian-like submarine eruptions of NNE-SSW aligned MS vents. The composition of the M1-M4 glasses ranges from basaltic trachyandesites to andesites and trachytes. The M1 to M4 magmas mainly originated by crystal fractionation from a heterogeneous mantle source with varying LILE enrichments by subduction-related fluids. The degree of evolution of the MS magmas increases with decreasing time. The formation of vertically stacked magma storage zones at the crust/mantle interface and within MS is related to the vanishing Southern Tyrrhenian Sea opening, which implies the rapid (<. 1. Ma) evolution from a slow spreading back-arc setting to an arc system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Back-arc spreading; Etna volcano; Extensional arc; Holocene tephra; Marsili Seamount; Plumbing system; Submarine active volcanism,Digital storage; Geochronology; Glass; Stratigraphy; Submarines; Back-arc; Etna volcanos; Extensional arc; Holocenes; Marsili seamounts; Plumbing Systems; Submarine geology; andesite; backarc basin; basalt; emplacement; extensional tectonics; Holocene; lava flow; magma; marine record; seamount; slab; spreading center; subduction; tephra; trachyte; volcanic eruption; volcanism; Calabrian Arc; Catania [Sicily]; Etna; Italy; Marsili Basin; Mediterranean Sea; Sicily; Tyrrhenian Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea; Trachytes,Article,Scopus,Marsili,39.26,14.378,3180,Seamount,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,environmental,,,,,

Our data show that from May 2011 to February 2012, the Nea Kameni fumaroles showed a significant increase of H2 concentrations. After this period, an abrupt decrease in the H2 contents, accompanied by decreasing seismic events, was recorded. A similar temporal pattern was shown by the F-, Cl-, SO42-, and NH4+ concentrations in the fumarolic condensates. During the sharp increase of H2 concentrations, when values up to 158 mmol/mol were measured, the d13C-CO2 values, which prior to January 2011 were consistent with a dominant CO2 thermometamorphic source, have shown a significant decrease, suggesting an increase of mantle CO2 contribution. Light hydrocarbons, including CH4, which are controlled by chemical reactions kinetically slower than H2 production from H2O dissociation, displayed a sharp increase in March 2012, under enhanced reducing conditions caused by the high H2 concentrations of May 2011-February 2012. The general increase in light hydrocarbons continued up to July 2012, notwithstanding the contemporaneous H2 decrease. The temporal patterns of CO2 concentrations and N2/Ar ratios increased similarly to that of H2, possibly due to sealing processes in the fumarolic conduits that diminished the contamination related to the entrance of atmospheric gases in the fumarolic conduits. The compositional evolution of the Nea Kameni fumaroles can be explained by a convective heat pulse from depth associated with the seismic activation of the NE-SW-oriented Kameni tectonic lineament, possibly triggered by either injection of new magma below Nea Kameni island, as apparently suggested by the evolution of the seismic and ground deformation activity, or increased permeability of the volcanic plumbing system resulting from the tectonic movements affecting the area. The results of the present study demonstrate that the geophysical and geochemical signals at Santorini are interrelated and may be precursory signals of renewed volcanic activity and encourage the development of interdisciplinary monitoring program to mitigate the volcanic risk in the most tourist-visited island of the Mediterranean Sea. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Fluid geochemistry; Geochemical monitoring; Santorini Island; Seismic crisis,concentration (composition); condensate; deformation; fumarole; geochemistry; hydrocarbon; isotopic analysis; permeability; reaction kinetics; seismotectonics; spatiotemporal analysis; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Santorini [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Palea,Article,Scopus,Santorini,36.4333,25.4,1,Volcanic Area,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

Here we present the results of investigations of tubeworms and endosymbionts from a shallow hydrothermal vent field in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

They harbor a single gammaproteobacterial endosymbiont. Carbon isotopic data, as well as the analysis of genes involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism indicate a sulfide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic endosymbiont.

Surprisingly, the endosymbiont harbors genes for two different carbon fixation pathways, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle as well as the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, as has been reported for the endosymbiont of the vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila. In addition to RubisCO genes we detected ATP citrate lyase (ACL - the key enzyme of the rTCA cycle) type II gene sequences using newly designed primer sets.

Surprisingly, the endosymbiont harbors genes for two different carbon fixation pathways, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle as well as the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, as has been reported for the endosymbiont of the vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila. In addition to RubisCO genes we detected ATP citrate lyase (ACL - the key enzyme of the rTCA cycle) type II gene sequences using newly designed primer sets. Comparative investigations with additional tubeworm species (Lamellibrachia luymesi, Lamellibrachia sp. 1, Lamellibrachia sp. 2, Escarpia laminata, Seepiophila jonesi) from multiple cold seep sites in the Gulf of Mexico revealed the presence of acl genes in these species as well. Thus, our study suggests that the presence of two different carbon fixation pathways, the CBB cycle and the rTCA cycle, is not restricted to the Riftia endosymbiont, but rather might be common in vestimentiferan tubeworm endosymbionts, regardless of the habitat.© 2012 Thiel, Hügler, Blümel, Baumann, Gärtner, Schmaljohann, Strauss, Garbe-Schönberg, Petersen, Cowart, Fisher and Imhoff.",Acl gene; Carbon fixation; Cbbm gene; Endosymbiont; Hydrothermal vent; Lamellibrachia; Mediterranean sea; Vestimentiferan tubeworm,NA,Article,Scopus,Palinuro,39.55,14.7,630,Volcanic Area,Italy,,Aeolian Arc,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

B/Ca compositions measured using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) show that boron uptake by C. caespitosa cultured at different pCO2 levels is independent of ambient seawater pH being mainly controlled by temperature-dependent calcification. In contrast, the boron isotope compositions (d11Bcarb) of the full suite of corals determined by positive thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (PTIMS) shows a clear trend of decreasing d11Bcarb (from 26.7 to 22.2‰) with decreasing seawater pH, reflecting the strong pH dependence of the boron isotope system.

It stands 3000 m above the surrounding oceanic crust of the 3500 m-deep Marsili back-arc basin and is axially located within the basin. The seamount has an elongated shape and presents distinctive morphology, with narrow (&lt; 1000 m) ridges, made up of several elongated cones, on the summit zone and extensive cone fields on its lower flanks. A dredging campaign carried out at water depths varying between 3400 and 600 m indicates that most of Marsili Seamount is composed of medium-K calc-alkaline basalts. Evolved high-K andesites were only recovered from the small cones on the summit axis zone. Petrological and geochemical characteristics of the least differentiated basalts reveal that at least two varieties of magmas have been erupted on the Marsili Volcano. Group 1 basalts have plagioclase and olivine as dominant phases and show lower Al, Ca, K, Ba, Rb and Sr, and higher Fe, Na, Ti and Zr with respect to a second type of basaltic magma. Group 2 basalts reveal the presence of clinopyroxene as an additional phenocryst phase. In addition, the two basaltic magmas have different original pre-eruptive H2O content (group 1, H2O-poor and group 2, H2O-rich). Moreover, comparison of the compositional trends and mineralogical compositions obtained from MELTS [Ghiorso, M.S., Sack, R.O., Contrib. Mineral. Petrol. 119 (1995) 197-212] fractional crystallization calculations reveal that the evolved andesites can only exclusively be derived from a low-pressure (0.3 kbar) fractionation of magmas compositionally similar to the least evolved group 2 basalts. Finally, we suggest that the high vesicularity of the basalts sampled at relatively great depths (&gt; 2400 m) on the edifice is governed by H2O and, probably, CO2 exsolution and is not a feature indicative of shallow water depth eruption. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Whilst we have a relatively good understanding of how these are shaped by temperature, for other emerging drivers, such as PCO2 we know relatively little. The marine polychaete Sabella spallanzanii increases its metabolic rate when exposed to high PCO2 conditions and remains absent from the CO2 vent of Ischia. To understand new possible pathways of sensitivity to CO2 in marine ectotherms, we examined the metabolic plasticity of S. spallanzanii exposed in situ to elevated PCO2 by measuring fundamental metabolite and carbonic anhydrase concentrations. We show that whilst this species can survive elevated PCO2 conditions in the short term, and exhibits an increase in energy metabolism, this is accompanied by a significant decrease in carbonic anhydrase concentration. These homeostatic changes are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term, indicating S. spallanzanii may struggle with future high PCO2 conditions. © 2015, Company of Biologists Ltd.

The average unsupported 210Pb inventory in the cores was calculated to be 3256 Bq m-2. The corresponding mean annual 210Pb flux of 105 Bq m-2 year-1 is comparable to estimates of the atmospheric flux given in the literature. 210Pb fluxes calculated from the unsupported 210Pb inventories in cores are also comparable with the 210Pb vertical fluxes determined from settling particles off the coast of Milos Island. The highest unsupported 210Pb concentrations (89 Bq kg-1) were measured in the sediments nearest to the hydrothermal vent area suggesting that the sedimentation rate is lowest at this site. Direct gamma measurements of 210Pb were used to date three sediment cores that are located at different distances from the vent zone: one is in the immediate vicinity of the vent; and others are outside the zone. Sedimentation rates for these cores, calculated using the CRS and CIC models, ranged from 0.088±0.008 cm year-1 to 0.14±0.01 cm year-1. Where both models were applicable, the results given by the two methods were in good agreement. 137Cs concentrations in all three cores generally declined with depth but showed no clear signal of either the period of maximum fallout from weapons testing or the Chernobyl accident. 210Po activities were also measured and the maximum 210Po concentration was in the sediment surface layer (166 Bq kg-1). © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study examined plant and sediment properties in seagrass meadows (Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Asch.) from two high pCO2–low pH Mediterranean vent systems, located at Milos (Greece) and Vulcano (Italy) Islands, providing insights on carbon storage potential in future acidified oceans. Contrary to what has been suggested, carbon content (both inorganic and organic) and its surficial accumulation decreased at high pCO2–low pH in comparison with controls. The decrease in inorganic carbon may result from the higher solubility of carbonates due to the more acidic conditions. At Vulcano, the seagrass properties (e.g., leaf area, biomass) appeared negatively affected by environmental conditions at high pCO2–low pH conditions and this may have had a detrimental effect on the organic carbon content and accumulation. At Milos, organic carbon decreased at high pCO2–low pH conditions, despite the increase in seagrass aboveground biomass, leaf length and area, probably as a consequence of site-specific features, which need further investigation and may include both biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., oligotrophic conditions, decreased sedimentation rate and input of allochthonous material). Results suggest that, in contrast to previous predictions based exclusively on the expected positive response of seagrasses to ocean acidification, carbon storage capacity of the seagrass C. nodosa may not increase at high pCO2-low pH conditions.

However, seagrass response to the harsh environmental conditions that arise due to explosive volcanism is as yet unexplored as it is not easy to predict when and where an eruption will occur. Here, we investigate the uptake of hydrothermal carbon within the seagrass Posidonia oceanica by the analysis of <U+0394>13C and growth rates in tissue laid down before and after an exceptional and massive hydrothermal gas release in the Aeolian Islands (Italy, Mediterranean Sea). Hydrothermal submarine activity was recorded by P. oceanica, which showed a large and persistent 13C-depletion in both scales and rhizomes in the site close to the eruption. Both increased CO2 availability and reduced carbon demand, as a consequence of stressful environmental conditions (e.g. light limitation due to turbidity, high temperature), combined to give much lower <U+0394>13C signatures. Our results suggest that the explosive volcanism caused physiological stress in the seagrass, leading to a reduction in productivity, whereas slower, more diffuse release of hydrothermal CO2 is known to enhance seagrass productivity. Synthesis. We analysed the effect of a sudden and large hydrothermal event on <U+0394>13C interannual variations and growth of the seagrass P. oceanica. Our results confirm that shallow submarine hydrothermal vents can be used as natural laboratories for exploring biological responses to acute and often extreme environmental conditions. P. oceanica can record geological events by capturing CO2 derived from vent systems, with implications for habitat management to mitigate against raising CO2 levels and ocean acidification. This leads the way to further studies to evaluate the effects of hydrothermal carbon on shallow ecosystems. © 2010 The Authors.

We used a dual geochemical proxy approach to estimate the calcifying fluid pH (pHcf) and carbonate chemistry of a Mediterranean coral (Balanophyllia europaea) naturally growing along a pH gradient (range: pHTS 8.07–7.74). The pHcf derived from skeletal boron isotopic composition (d11B) was 0.3–0.6 units above seawater values and homogeneous along the gradient (mean ± SEM: Site 1 = 8.39 ± 0.03, Site 2 = 8.34 ± 0.03, Site 3 = 8.34 ± 0.02). Also carbonate ion concentration derived from B/Ca was homogeneous [mean ± SEM (µmol kg–1): Site 1 = 579 ± 34, Site 2 = 541 ± 27, Site 3 = 568 ± 30] regardless of seawater pH. Furthermore, gross calcification rate (GCR, mass of CaCO3 deposited on the skeletal unit area per unit of time), estimated by a “bio-inorganic model” (IpHRAC), was homogeneous with decreasing pH. The homogeneous GCR, internal pH and carbonate chemistry confirm that the features of the “building blocks” – the fundamental structural components – produced by the biomineralization process were substantially unaffected by increased acidification. Furthermore, the pH up-regulation observed in this study could potentially explain the previous hypothesis that less “building blocks” are produced with increasing acidification ultimately leading to increased skeletal porosity and to reduced net calcification rate computed by including the total volume of the pore space. In fact, assuming that the available energy at the three sites is the same, this energy at the low pH sites could be partitioned among fewer calicoblastic cells that consume more energy given the larger difference between external and internal pH compared to the control, leading to the production of less building blocks (i.e., formation of pores inside the skeleton structure, determining increased porosity). However, we cannot exclude that also dissolution may play a role in increasing porosity. Thus, the ability of scleractinian corals to maintain elevated pHcf relative to ambient seawater might not always be sufficient to counteract declines in net calcification under OA scenarios. © Copyright © 2019 Wall, Prada, Fietzke, Caroselli, Dubinsky, Brizi, Fantazzini, Franzellitti, Mass, Montagna, Falini and Goffredo.",Balanophyllia europaea; boron; calcifying fluid; carbonate chemistry; Mediterranean Sea; ocean acidification; pH up-regulation,NA,Article,Scopus,Panarea,38.5568,15.1097,23,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Aeolian Arc,biological,,macrobenthos,Anthozoa,Balanophyllia europaea,calcification

Gas hydrates and methane seeps are frequently found in cold seep areas and were anticipated targets of the MEDINAUT/MEDINETH initiatives. The study presented herein has utilized a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating observations and sampling of visually selected sites by the manned submersible Nautile and by ship-based sediment coring and geophysical surveys. The study focuses on the biogeochemical and ecological processes and conditions related to methane seepage, especially the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), associated with ascending fluids on Kazan mud volcano in the eastern Mediterranean. Sampling of adjacent box cores for studies on the microbiology, biomarkers, pore water and solid phase geochemistry allowed us to integrate different biogeochemical data within a spatially highly heterogeneous system. Geophysical results clearly indicate the spatial heterogeneity of mud volcano environments. Results from pore water geochemistry and modeling efforts indicate that the rate of AOM is ~6 mol m-2 year-1, which is lower than at active seep sites associated with conditions of focused flow, but greater than diffusion-dominated sites. Furthermore, under the non-focused flow conditions at Kazan mud volcano advective flow velocities are of the order of a few centimeters per year and gas hydrate formation is predicted to occur at a sediment depth of about 2 m and below. The methane flux through these sediments supports a large and diverse community of micro- and macrobiota, as demonstrated by carbon isotopic measurements on bulk organic matter, authigenic carbonates, specific biomarker compounds, and macrofaunal tissues. Because the AOM community appears to be able to completely oxidize methane at the rate it is seeping through the sediments, ultimate sinks for methane in this environment are authigenic carbonates and biomass. Significant differences in organic geochemical data between this site and those of other cold seep environments, even within the eastern Mediterranean mud volcanoes, indicate that the microbiological communities carrying out AOM varies depending on specific conditions such as methane flux and salinity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Many different classes of lipids have been identified and attributed to methane-oxidizing archaea, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methane-oxidizing bacteria, and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, as well as older organic matter associated with the ascending mud diapirs in the region. Of particular interest is the record of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) derived from various types of archaea. A geochemical depth profile of the upper 30 cm of sediment allows the assessment of vertical variability in the microbial community, which proves to be diverse based on molecular isotopic analyses, and the importance of present-day microbes relative to paleo-organic matter. In this environment, it seems that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) has progressed at relatively low rates or for a shorter time compared with other seep sites, based on the high relative abundance of organic matter associated with the ascending mud matrix rather than with AOM, and the carbon isotopic composition of GDGT-derived biphytanes. The presence of many different biomarkers of AOM-related microbes with varying depth trends in both concentration and carbon isotope composition suggests substantial variability in the microbial community on a small vertical scale (~30 cm). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, new results of B and d11B in 41 hydrothermal vent waters collected from the shallow hydrothermal system of Milos island in the Aegean Sea were combined with previously published data from other tectonic settings and laboratory experiments to quantify the effects of phase separation, fluid/sediment interaction and magmatic contribution. Two Cl-extreme solutions were identified, high-Cl waters (Cl as high as 2000 mM) and low-Cl waters (Cl &lt;80 mM). Both sets of waters were characterized by high B/Cl (~1.2-5.3 × 10-3 mol/mol) and extremely low d11B (1.4-6.3‰), except for the waters with Mg content of near the seawater value and d11B = 10.3-17.4‰. These high-Cl waters with high B/Cl and low d11B plot close to the vent waters in sediment-hosted hydrothermal system (i.e., Okinawa Trough) or fumarole condensates from on-land volcanoes, implying B addition from sediment or magmatic fluids plays an important role. This is in agreement with fluid/sediment interactions resulting in the observed B and d11B, as well as previously reported Br/I/Cl ratios, supporting a scenario of slab-derived fluid addition with elevated B, 11B-rich, and low Br/Cl and I/Cl, which is derived from the dehydration of subducted-sediments. The slab fluid becomes subsequently mixed with the parent magma of Milos. The deep brine reservoir is partially affected by injections of magmatic fluid/gases during degassing. The results presented here are crucial for deciphering the evolution of the brine reservoirs involved in phase separation, fluid/sediment interaction and magmatic contribution in the deep reaction zone of the Milos hydrothermal system; they also have implications in the understanding of the formation of metallic vein mineralization. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Boron isotope; Hydrothermal system; Magmatic fluids; Milos; Water/rock interaction,Boron; Geothermal springs; Hot springs; Hydrothermal synthesis; Isotopes; Landforms; Phase separation; Sediments; Boron isotopes; Hydrothermal system; Hydrothermal vent; Laboratory experiments; Magmatic fluids; Milos; Submarine hydrothermal system; Tectonic settings; Cobalt deposits; boron isotope; hydrothermal fluid; hydrothermal system; hydrothermal vent; magmatism; water-rock interaction; Aegean Sea; Cyclades; Greece; Mediterranean Sea; Milos [Cyclades]; Milos [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean,Article,Scopus,Milos,36.6667,24.5167,32,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

The cave fluids discharge through rock fissures near sea-level and have low pH, chlorinity, and B concentrations relative to seawater. The submarine-brine fluids are characterized by high Cl and contain >10 times seawater B concentrations. A scenario involving a two-cells circulation is proposed; one occurs at 1-2 km and another at shallower depth. The deeper saline reservoir has experienced subcritical phase separation, partitioning 0.42 mM B in vapor and 6.8 mM in brine with no detectable isotopic fractionation. The reaction temperature in the saline reservoir is 313C calculated from the Na-K-Ca geothermometry. The vapors rise directly to form the cave vents, whereas the saline fluids transport in different pathways and are influenced by seawater mixing to form the variable submarine-brine fluids. The seawater-like fluids circulate at shallower depths, where calculated temperature is 248C and show slightly diluted B (0.36-0.41 mM) and seawater d11B. These fluids probably resulted from heating of down-flow seawater and may have experienced groundwater discharge and partial Mg removal.

Santorini has produced numerous highly explosive eruptions over at least the past ~360 kyrs that are documented by the island's unique proximal tephra record. However, the lack of precise eruption ages and comprehensive glass geochemical datasets for proximal tephras has long hindered the development of a detailed distal tephrostratigraphy for Santorini eruptions. In light of these requirements, this study develops a distal tephrostratigraphy for Santorini covering the past ~360 kyrs, which represents a major step forward towards the establishment of a tephrostratigraphic framework for the Eastern Mediterranean region. We present new EPMA glass geochemical data of proximal tephra deposits from twelve Plinian and numerous Inter-Plinian Santorini eruptions and use this dataset to establish assignments of 28 distal marine tephras from three Aegean Sea cores (KL49, KL51 and LC21) to specific volcanic events. Based on interpolation of sapropel core chronologies we provide new eruption age estimates for correlated Santorini tephras, including dates for major Plinian eruptions, Upper Scoriae 1 (80.8 ± 2.9 ka), Vourvoulos (126.5 ± 2.9 ka), Middle Pumice (141.0 ± 2.6 ka), Cape Thera (156.9 ± 2.3 ka), Lower Pumice 2 (176.7 ± 0.6 ka), Lower Pumice 1 (185.7 ± 0.7 ka), and Cape Therma 3 (200.2 ± 0.9 ka), but also for 17 Inter-Plinian events. Older Plinian and Inter-Plinian activity between ~310 ka and 370 ka, documented in the distal terrestrial setting of Tenaghi Philippon (NE Greece), is independently dated by palynostratigraphy and complements the distal Santorini tephrostratigraphic record. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Eastern Mediterranean region; EPMA glass chemistry; Land-sea correlations; Marine tephrostratigraphy; Proximal tephra deposits; Santorini,geochemistry; glass; Pleistocene; plinian eruption; sapropel; stratigraphy; tephra; volcanic island; volcanism; Aegean Sea; Central Macedonia; Greece; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Santorini [Southern Aegean]; Serrai [Central Macedonia]; Southern Aegean; Tenaghi Philippon; Thera,Review,Scopus,Santorini,36.4333,25.4,1,Volcanic Area,Greece,,Aegean Arc,environmental,,,,,

The physiologically active prokaryotic assemblage in this extreme environment showed a great genetic diversity. Most members of the microbial community appeared to be affiliated to yet uncultured organisms from similar ecosystems, i.e., deep-sea hypersaline basins and hydrothermal vents. The bacterial clone library was dominated by phylotypes affiliated with the epsilon-Proteobacteria subdivision recognized as an ecologically significant group of bacteria inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal environments. Almost 18% of all bacterial clones were related to delta-Proteobacteria, suggesting that sulfate reduction is one of the dominant metabolic processes occurring in warm mud fluids. The remaining bacterial phylotypes were related to alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Deinococcus-Thermus, KB1 and OP-11 candidate divisions. Moreover, a novel monophyletic clade, deeply branched with unaffiliated 16S rDNA clones was also retrieved from deep-sea sediments and halocline of Urania Basin. Archaeal diversity was much lower and detected phylotypes included organisms affiliated exclusively with the Euryarchaeota. More than 96% of the archaeal clones belonged to the MSBL-1 candidate order recently found in hypersaline anoxic environments, such as endoevaporitic microbial mats, Mediterranean deep-sea mud volcanoes and anoxic basins. Two phylotypes, represented by single clones were related to uncultured groups DHVE-1 and ANME-1. Thus, the hydrothermal mud of hypersaline Urania Basin seems to contain new microbial diversity. The prokaryotic community was significantly different from that occurring in the upper layers of the Urania Basin since 60% of all bacterial and 40% of all archaeal phylotypes were obtained only from mud fluids. The uniqueness of the composition of the active prokaryotic community could be explained by the complex environmental conditions at the site. The interaction of oxygenated warm mud fluids with the cold hypersaline brine of the Urania Basin seems to simultaneously select for various metabolic processes, such as aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophy, sulfide- and methane-dependent chemotrophy along with anaerobic oxidation of methane, sulfate- and metal-reduction. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",16S rRNA; Deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins; Hydrothermal mud fluids; Microbial community structure and function,"archaeal DNA; archaeal RNA; ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; anoxic conditions; chemoautotrophy; cladistics; clone; deep-sea benthos; extremophile; heterotrophy; hydrothermal vent community; microbial community; oxidation; prokaryote; reduction; saline lake; sulfate; anoxia; article; chemistry; ecosystem; genetics; Mediterranean Sea; metabolism; microbiology; molecular cloning; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Thermus; Anoxia; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Archaeal; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Sea; Microbiology; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Archaeal; RNA, Ribosomal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Thermus; Water Microbiology; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America; Urania; Actinobacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Bacteroides (class); Betaproteobacteria; Deinococcus; Deinococcus-Thermus; Deltaproteobacteria; Epsilonproteobacteria; Euryarchaeota; Prokaryota; Thermus; Urania",Article,Scopus,Urania,35.230833,21.473333,3700,Hydrothermal Vents,Greece,methane,Eastern Mediterranean,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

We investigated a complex system of mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean Sea characterised by the presence of different structures (i.e., isolated domes, domes surrounded by moats, clustered domes, and ridges) displaying different levels of seepage. We hypothesize that the combined effects of seafloor heterogeneity (i.e., different 3-D structures as revealed by detailed topographic analysis), fluid emissions and trophic characteristics of these systems can influence the structural and functional biodiversity of meiofauna (with special focus on the nematodes). We found that sediments affected by intensive seepage displayed the lowest faunal abundances and number of higher taxa. However, mud volcanoes without emissions, but characterized by a high structural complexity (such as the ridges), were associated with the highest meiofaunal abundances and number of higher taxa. Mud volcanoes hosted also a remarkable abundance of rare taxa specifically associated with these structures (e.g., acarians, cumaceans, tanaids, cladocerans and hydroids) and absent in slope sediments (used as a control). Each mud-volcano area displayed a different nematode species composition. Overall 76 nematode species (from a total of 235) were exclusively associated with mud-volcano structures, whilst 29 were exclusively encountered in slope sediments. We conclude that the presence of mud volcanoes, for their contribution to increase spatial heterogeneity and for the extreme conditions associated with gas emissions, promotes higher levels of beta diversity, thus enhancing the regional (gamma) benthic diversity. These findings provide new insights on the factors controlling meiobenthic biodiversity in mud volcanoes and clues for future action of conservation of the biodiversity specifically associated with these habitats. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,3D structures; Benthic ecosystems; Cold seeps; Combined effect; Different structure; Extreme conditions; Fluid emissions; Functional biodiversity; Hot spot; Mediterranean sea; Meiofauna; Mud volcanoes; Rare taxa; Sea floor; Slope sediment; Spatial heterogeneity; Species composition; Structural complexity; Topographic analysis; Anoxic sediments; Associated gas; Biodiversity; Domes; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Sedimentology; Seepage; Three dimensional; Volcanoes; abundance; benthic environment; biodiversity; cluster analysis; cold seep; community composition; emission; habitat type; heterogeneity; hot spot; meiofauna; mud volcano; nematode; sediment analysis; seepage; slope; spatial analysis; species diversity; taxonomy; three-dimensional modeling; trophic environment; Mediterranean Sea; Cumacea; Hydrozoa; Nematoda; Tanaidae,Article,Scopus,Sicily-south,36.571111,14.5025,141,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Sicily Channel,environmental,,,,,

Mud volcanoes hosted also a remarkable abundance of rare taxa specifically associated with these structures (e.g., acarians, cumaceans, tanaids, cladocerans and hydroids) and absent in slope sediments (used as a control). Each mud-volcano area displayed a different nematode species composition. Overall 76 nematode species (from a total of 235) were exclusively associated with mud-volcano structures, whilst 29 were exclusively encountered in slope sediments. We conclude that the presence of mud volcanoes, for their contribution to increase spatial heterogeneity and for the extreme conditions associated with gas emissions, promotes higher levels of beta diversity, thus enhancing the regional (gamma) benthic diversity. These findings provide new insights on the factors controlling meiobenthic biodiversity in mud volcanoes and clues for future action of conservation of the biodiversity specifically associated with these habitats. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,3D structures; Benthic ecosystems; Cold seeps; Combined effect; Different structure; Extreme conditions; Fluid emissions; Functional biodiversity; Hot spot; Mediterranean sea; Meiofauna; Mud volcanoes; Rare taxa; Sea floor; Slope sediment; Spatial heterogeneity; Species composition; Structural complexity; Topographic analysis; Anoxic sediments; Associated gas; Biodiversity; Domes; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Sedimentology; Seepage; Three dimensional; Volcanoes; abundance; benthic environment; biodiversity; cluster analysis; cold seep; community composition; emission; habitat type; heterogeneity; hot spot; meiofauna; mud volcano; nematode; sediment analysis; seepage; slope; spatial analysis; species diversity; taxonomy; three-dimensional modeling; trophic environment; Mediterranean Sea; Cumacea; Hydrozoa; Nematoda; Tanaidae,Article,Scopus,Sicily-south,36.571111,14.5025,141,Mud Volcano,Italy,,Sicily Channel,biological,,bacteria,,,survival

We investigated a complex system of mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean Sea characterised by the presence of different structures (i.e., isolated domes, domes surrounded by moats, clustered domes, and ridges) displaying different levels of seepage. We hypothesize that the combined effects of seafloor heterogeneity (i.e., different 3-D structures as revealed by detailed topographic analysis), fluid emissions and trophic characteristics of these systems can influence the structural and functional biodiversity of meiofauna (with special focus on the nematodes). We found that sediments affected by intensive seepage displayed the lowest faunal abundances and number of higher taxa.

The U234 U238 ratio is in the majority of cases close to that of seawater; only in a few cases is it anomalously high. Anomalous U234 U238 ratios are coupled with low U concentrations. These data are explained by a model where thermal water (essentially heated seawater) in its sub-bottom circulation often is unable to leach U from the basaltic oceanic crust; in fact, these thermal waters may in some cases lose U. When leaching of U from the basalt does take place, probably during shallow stages of the sub-bottom circulation, the resulting anomalous U234 U238 ratio can be preserved in the hydrothermal deposit only if mixing with 'seawater' U is prevented.

Metals discharging from hydrothermal vents are selectively precipitated at increasing distances from the hydrothermal sources, leading to a compositional zonation in both sediments and waters. Fe is markedly enriched in both the waters and sediments of the inner exhalative zone close to the hydrothermal vents, but decreases rapidly in the former to values similar to those of normal seawater in the outer exhalative zone âˆ¼ 50-100 m from the vents. Generally, Mn also decreases in the waters away from the vents, as does Zn, but both less sharply than Fe. By contrast, Mn shows an enrichment in sediments at increasing distances from the vents. The distribution of the minor elements can be related to both their rate of supply in the hydrothermal fluids and their removal to the sediments by scavenging, although other controls on their abundance such as detrital and biogenic supply are of variable importance at increasing distances from the vents.

The mineralization is made up of indurated sulfide crusts interpreted to have been deposited by a seawater/sediment interface and mixed with ooze of organic and volcanic origin. A preliminary investigation of the economic minerals showed besides luzonite and tennantite-tetrahedrite, native (rare) copper?, all associated with pyrite predominantly and baryte. Native silver, bismuthinite and stibnite were also found. A dust-like white precipitate was observed by submersible close to the mineralized zone but no structures or edifices resembling black smokers have yet been identified. Massive pyrite deposits associated with such uncommon mineral assemblages are found in the high level volcanic parts of porphyry copper systems, or associated with base metal lodes. The massive sulfide discovery is suggested to have a volcanogenic exhalative origin and a genetic relationship with porphyry coppers or base metal sulfide lodes.

The sediments at the most active hot submarine spring (at SW Nea Kameni) consist of 40-48% Fe2O3 and 8-15% SiO2, but only little Al2O3 (0.5-1.6%), P (0.1-0.3%), Mn (100-450 ppm), Sr, Zr, Ba, Zn and V (âˆ¼30-200 ppm) and Cu, Ni and Y (âˆ¼ 1-30 ppm) are present. The sediments contain more Fe and P and less Si, Al, Mn and many trace elements than sediments formed at less active springs at Palaea Kameni; the differences probably being caused by faster deposition rates of Fe at Nea Kameni and less dilution by rock detritus, which delivers Al, Si and Mn. The Santorini sediments differ much from other exhalative sediments at present or old spreading centers, for example on the East Pacific Rise, in the Red Sea or at En Kafala, which are rich in Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni and Ba. Hydrothermal rock leaching probably occurs at much lower pH-values at Santorini than on the East Pacific Rise, causing a more complete breakdown of the leached rock at Santorini. The very low trace element to iron ratios in the rocks at Santorini, therefore, prevent the hydrothermal solutions there from being very rich in trace elements. The very acid leaching solutions at Santorini are created by extensive oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid, a process that is readily possible due to the close proximity of the oxygen-rich atmosphere to the top of the magma chamber.

Basaltic to rhyolitic lava samples dredged from these localities mostly belong to calc-alkaline and shoshonitic associations and are strictly comparable, both in petrographical and geochemical characteristics, to subaerial products outcropping on the Eolian islands. Moreover a few tholeiitic basalts, with island arc affinity, have been recovered for the first time from north Lametini and lowermost Eolian slope. The calc-alkaline magmatic activity appears to date as far back as 1.3-0.9 Â± 0.2 m.y. to the west (Sisifo Seamount) and probably postdates (or is synchronous with) the tholeiitic episodes, whereas the oldest shoshonitic volcanism so far found at Eolo and Enarete Seamounts has an age of 0.85-0.64 Â± 0.06 m.y. The geochronological data indicate a general trend of within-serial rejuvenation of the volcanism moving counterclockwise from the Sisifo area, as well as a chronological zonation of magmatic products characterized by a rapid transition, within the time span of about 0.1 m.y., to more abundant shoshonitic and leucite-tephritic lavas in limited portions of the structure (Lipari, Vulcano and Stromboli). Model calculations based on a large spectrum of incompatible elements indicate that the parental melts of the various magma series could be derived by different partial melting degrees of spinel- to garnet-peridotite mantle sources heterogeneously enriched through the influx of distinct metasomatizing fluids driven off the subduction zone. Subduction reactivation and the related Eolian volcanism appear to be diachronous with respect to the oceanic spreading in the Tyrrhenian marginal basin and characteristically analogous, in timing, to the tectonic and magmatic evolution of the western Pacific island arc and back arc basin systems, where an earlier opening of the marginal basin was followed by an arc volcanism on the rifted-off migrating plate. The chronological zonation inside limited sectors of the structure coupled with the widespread age of volcanism of different serial affinity along the whole structure and the counterclockwise rejuvenation of the within-serial magmatic activity, could be related to deformation (via torsion, segmentation and lateral stretching) and progressive steepening of the subducted slab resulting in the present concavity of the Benioff zone which corresponds to a maximal oroclinal distortion of the Apenninic-Maghrebian chain.

Four dives in the Cyana submersible showed that this voluminous volcanic edifice (350-400 km3) can be divided into two parts: (1) from its base to 1500 m deep, a pile of thick submarine basaltic flows; and (2) an upper part, above 1500 m, consisting of smaller radial lava flows related to a major central volcano (Vavilov s.s.) and other minor vents aligned north-south. The basal series is affected by normal faults, directed north to N40Â°, and strongly tilted westward, like the neighbouring Sardinian continental block. Radiometric ages of upper lavas range from 0.1 to 0.4 Ma. Other observations suggest that the late phase of construction has been subaerial, and lead to estimate the Upper Quaternary subsidence of the basin to at least 500 m (4-5 mm yr-1). Although Vavilov is located at the supposed centre of oceanic accretion, the characteristics of its lavas strongly differ from those of the underlying crust. The basalts fall into the mildly alkaline series and are strongly enriched in light REE. Among the products of passive margin volcanism, they may be compared with intermediate basalts between the olivine-tholeiite of the continental flood basalts and the P-type oceanic basalts; in terms of oceanic volcanism, they are very close to Oceanic Island Basalts (OIB). Vavilov appears as a structure independent of the oceanic crust which supports it, and does not represent a ridge related to the oceanic accretion as one might suppose.

The model is mainly based on the distribution of trace elements such as Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, and P in modern biogenic metalliferous sediments and Proterozoic banded iron-formations, but also on carbon isotope data of both carbonates and reduced elemental carbon. One of the characteristics of banded Fe-formations is that they are poor in trace elements. An argument in favour of a combined hydrothermal/biogenic model would therefore be that some of the modern analogues, too, are associated with very little trace elements. Such sediments are microbiologically precipitated in areas with restricted water circulation and limited amounts of free oxygen, which favours the oxidation of reduced Fe by microaerophilic chemolithotrophic bacteria relative to inorganic oxidation. The biological enzymatic pathway for the oxidation excludes the participation and co-precipitation of transition metals other than iron until the original amorphous Fe oxide hydroxide precipitate is transformed to the crystalline polymorphs. The wide lateral microband continuity of many banded Fe-formations could be explained by injection, interleaving and horizontal spreading of chemically reduced hydrothermal solutions in an early ocean with limited amounts of free O2. Due to the low O2 concentrations Fe would be precipitated slowly as an effect of mainly microbiological oxidation. Periods of Fe precipitation from hot hydrothermal solutions would alternate with periods of precipitation of silica from cool hydrothermal solutions. Â© 1987, D. Reidel Publishing Company.

Bi in the sediments falls within the range of its concentrations in normal clastic sediments. As/Fe ratios in the sediments increase with increasing distance from the hydrothermal vents which, coupled with a strong association between As and Fe demonstrated by partition analysis, suggests that hydrothermal As is scavenged into the sediments by freshly precipitating Fe-oxides and that the conditions for this become increasingly favourable away from the vents.

Geostatisti-cal analysis, followed by further selective leaches on a number of samples, has been used in order to identify any regional hydrothermal influence on the sediments and/or any local hydrothermal metal enrichments. The two main sediment components affecting the geochemical variability in the region are biogenic carbonate and volcaniclastic/terrigenous detritus. Proximity to islands appears to be the primary factor controlling the variability in these components. Sediments from deeper water, to the south of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc and in the Anydros Basin, exhibit some elevated levels of Mn, Co, and Cu, probably of hydrogenous origin. No widespread hydrothermal influence to the sediments in the region is recognized, although this could in part be due to the high sedimentation rates in the region. Localized hydrothermal inputs to sediments are, however, recognized proximal to Santorini, in particular within the northern part of the central caldera. These are predominantly of Fe and associated adsorbed/coprecipitated elements along with some Mn enrichment. Several samples proximal to Milos, just off the coast in the northern part of the central Milos embayment, also show enrichments of commonly hydrothermally associated elements, including Mn, Cu, Zn, and Pb. Data suggest that these enrichments could, in part, be due to weathering of â€œon-landâ€; mineralization as well as hydrothermal inputs.

The deep to intermediate portions of the volcano are made up by calc-alkaline basalts, whereas the summit consists of high-potassium calc-alkaline andesites. The contents of MgO, CaO, total iron, Cr, Ni and V decrease with increasing silica, while K2O, Rb, Ba, Th, Nb and LREE exhibit the opposite behavior. The andesite lavas of the top, at waterdepth shallower than about 800 m, are younger than 0.2 Ma. Composition of the basalts varies with the waterdepth; overall, the deepest products of Marsili are geochemically more mafic than those erupted in the higher physiographic positions. Geochemical features suggest the existence of a mantle source that was modified by metasomatic acquirement of subduction-derived incompatible elements. The seamount lies on oceanic crust which formed above subducting lithosphere not earlier than about 2 Ma ago. It is currently undergoing extension along linear faults. The major distensional fractures trend N-S to N15Â°E paralleling the physiographic elongation of the volcano. At the summit, later faults have an oblique NE-SW orientation which is associated with the eruption of high-potassium andesites. The transition from basalts to high-potassium andesites is discussed as a possible response to the extension and rapid subsidence that dominate the volcano and surrounding region.

Four areas containing one or more mud diapirs have been investigated through bathymetric profiling, single channel seismic reflection profiling, heat flow measurements, and coring. A sequence of events is identified in the evolution of the mud diapirs: initially the expulsion on the seafloor of gasrich mud produces a seafloor depression outlined in the seismic record by downward dip of the host sediment reflectors towards the mud conduit; subsequent eruptions of fluid mud may create a flat topped mud volcano with step-like profile; finally, the intrusion of viscous mud produces a mud cone. The origin of the diapirs is deep within the Mediterranean Ridge. Although a minimum depth of about 400 m below the seafloor has been computed from the hydrostatic balance between the diapiric sediments and the host sediments, a maximum depth, suggested by geometric considerations, ranges between 5.3 and 7 km. The presence of thermogenic gas in the diapiric sediments suggests a better constrained origin depth of at least 2.2 km. The heat flow measured within the Olimpi mud diapir field and along a transect orthogonal to the diapiric field is low, ranging between 16 Â± 5 and 41 Â± 6 mW m-2. Due to the presence of gas, the thermal conductivity of the diapiric sediments is lower than that of the host hemipelagic oozes (0.6-0.9 and 1.0-1.15 W m-1 K-1 respectively). We consider the distribution of mud diapirs to be controlled by the presence of tectonic features such as reverse faults or thrusts (inner escarpment) that develop where the thickness of the Late Miocene evaporites appears to be minimum. An upward migration through time of the position of the dÃ©collement within the stratigraphic column from the Upper Oligocene (diapiric sediments) to the Upper Miocene (present position) is identified.

The gases in these fluids contain mostly CO2 but CH4 concentrations up to 2% are present. The stable carbon isotopic composition of the CO2 (near 0â€°) indicates an inorganic carbon source (dissociation of underlying marine carbonates). The carbon and hydrogen isotopes of most CH4 samples are enriched in the heavy species (Î´13C = -9.4 to -17.8â€°; Î´D = -102 to -189â€°) which is believed to be characteristic for an abiogenic production of CH4 by CO2-reduction (Fischer-Tropsch reactions). Depletions in the deuterium content of three CH4 samples (to -377â€°) are probably caused by unknown subsurface rock alteration processes. Secondary hydrogen isotope exchange processes between methane, hydrogen and water are most likely responsible for calculated unrealistic methane formation temperatures. We show that excess helium, slightly enriched in 3He, is present in the hydrothermal fluids emerging the seafloor of Paleohori Bay. When the isotopic ratio of the excess component is calculated a 3He/4Heexcess of 3.6 Â· 10-6 is obtained.

Water samples were collected from submarine 'fumaroles' which discharge hot (âˆ¼ 50-100Â°C), acidic, gas-rich, low-chlorinity fluids into the shallow embayment of Porto di Levante, adding dissolved Si, K, Li, Rb, Fe, Mn, NH3 and H2S into surrounding seawater. These fluids are interpreted as a mixture of seawater and low-salinity groundwater which has undergone high-temperature (&gt; 100Â°C) hydrothermal alteration, followed by mixing with cool seawater in the sub-seafloor and during venting. The fluid compositions also suggest the chemical 'overprint' of reactions resulting from the input of significant amounts of the volcanic gases CO2, SO2 and H2S at this site, specifically, the attack of igneous silicate phases by dissolved CO2, and the hydrolysis and oxidation of SO2 and H2S to SO2-4, H+ and elemental sulphur. These overprinting reactions have been proposed for other gas-rich submarine hydrothermal fluids collected from shallow island-arc and hotspot volcanoes, and may be typical of such settings. Several water samples were also collected from a site where warm (&lt;30Â°C) fluids seep from volcanic sand, and are enriched in dissolved Si, K, Li, Rb, Mg, Ca, and particularly Fe and Mn relative to ambient seawater. These solutions are interpreted as the result of low-temperature (&lt;100Â°C) hydrothermal alteration of seawater, again overprinted by the addition of acidic volcanic gases; the warm, acidic fluids then leach Si and metal cations, including Mg2+, from the volcanic sands. The elevated H2S concentrations and low pH of 'ambient' embayment water relative to typical surface ocean waters suggest that this type of hydrothermal activity significantly alters the redox and pH conditions of local seawater.",,"geochemistry; groundwater; hydrothermal alteration; seawater; submarine spring; submarine springs; volcanic arc; volcanic gas; Italy, Aeolian Islands, Vulcano; Tyrrhenian Sea, Aeolian Islands, Vulcano",Article,Scopus,Vulcano,38.4,15,1,Hydrothermal Vents,Italy,CO2,Aeolian Arc,environmental,water/gas,,,,

Terraces deposits are up to 20-30 m thick and are flat-topped with well- defined edges. They extend up to 1 km in dip section. The deposits are composed of intrabasinal sediments, mainly bioclastic sand and silt and are probably due to deposition below the storm wave-base during large-scale energy episodes. Two areas of the Tyrrhenian Sea have been analysed, one in a volcanic context (the Pontine archipelago) and the other in a highly active structural context (the Calabrian Arch). Similar wave-built terraces were found in both areas, with a main terrace placed at a depth of 100 -150 m, which is thought to be Wurmian. Older terraces are also present, emplaced during the preceding lowstands in the Late Pleistocene. A possible present- day terrace is found at about 20 m depth in the Pontine archipelago. A mechanism of subsequent formation below wave base-level and removal because of sea level lowering has been hypothesised during long-lasting periods of Late Pleistocene sea level falls.

The brine fluid outcropped as a pool of water in a seabed depression and was detected in the surrounding pore-waters of sediments colonised by the sulphur bacterium Achromatium volutans. The seep fluid was highly saline and sulphidic, depleted in Mg2+ and SO4/2-, but enriched over seawater in Na+, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, SiO2, reduced species and dissolved gases. The high concentrations of Na+, Ca2+ and K+ were consistent with the Milos tectonic setting. Na-K and Na-K-Ca geothermometers predicted a reservoir temperature of 300-325Â°C for the most concentrated seep samples. The deep geothermal reservoir within the metamorphic basement of Milos island has already been located and studied and may represent the source of the seep fluid.

Both volcanoes mark the site of active gas and fluid venting from deep within the sedimentary pile. Large volumes of mud breccia have been extruded onto the volcano slopes. For the first time, clasts up to c. 1 m in size have been recovered from sea-floor mud volcanoes. The submarine clasts show lithologies ranging from shallow water bioclastic sandstones to marls and limestones, dated using microfauna as Oligocene, Miocene and perhaps Cretaceous in age.

The organic material in the mud breccia of the Napoli mud volcano is a mixture of different facies, stratigraphic origin and thermal maturities. One portion is synsedimentary organic material with only minor diagenetic alterations and represents sedimenting material that was embedded into the mud volcano during its extrusion. The mud breccia also contains thermally mature organic material of mainly terrestrial provenance with algae of fresh- and brackish-water origin. Vitrinite reflectance data of this maturity generation range from 0.65 to 0.90% Roil and thus characterize thermally mature source rocks, a rank which is corroborated by fluorescence and molecular characteristics. The predominance of vitrinite in the maceral assemblages and the occurrence of biomarkers of terrigenous origin suggest that the major part of the mud matrix derives from a lacustrine or riverine sedimentary unit in the subsurface, possibly from the Messinian stage. A third generation of organic material includes inertinites and vitrinites of high reflectance, which represent recycled organic matter present in any marine sediment. By use of the Lopatin method for modelling the thermal maturation of hydrocarbon source rocks from the vitrinite reflectance data, we calculated that the depth of mobilization ranges from 4900 m to 7500 m, depending upon the temperature gradient used.",Burial; Mud volcanoes; Organic carbon; Organic materials; Thermal maturity,"burial depth; mud volcano; mud volcanoes; organic carbon; thermal maturity; vitrinite reflectance; Mediterranean Sea, Mediterranean Ridge",Article,Scopus,Napoli,33.729087,24.682377,1946,Mud Volcano,Greece,,Olimpi mud field,environmental,sediment,,,,

The cores have been analyzed chemically for a suite of elements, including selective chemical leaching, to determine the partition of elements between coexisting phases. Lithologically and chemically, the sediments from the two embayments are very different. Sediments from PK are oxidized in the upper parts of the cores and reduced at depth; they comprise mainly hydrothermal pyritiferous diatomaceous ooze with minor Fe oxyhydroxide, volcanic debris, gypsum, and siderite. Sediments from NK are oxidized throughout and comprise predominantly amorphous iron oxyhydroxides and goethite; they are thought to have formed by direct precipitation from solution. In PK, biogenic, detrital seawater evaporate, and hydrothermal sediment phases have been identified but only the detrital inputs can be correlated between cores. Mn shows a pronounced enrichment towards the outer part of the embayment because of its dispersion down the embayment and precipitation in the more-oxidizing sediments towards the open sea. In NK, the sediments contain detrital, seawater evaporate, and hydrothermally precipitated and scavenged phases. The presence of substantial amounts of organic matter in the PK sediments but not in the NK sediments is probably the main reason why geochemical processes in the two embayments are different. Age dates obtained from the cores by using the 14C technique indicate that sedimentation in the PK embayment commenced at âˆ¼ 50 AD, whereas in the NK embayment it commenced at âˆ¼ 1900 AD, which is consistent with the known history of Santorini. Based on these dates, calculated metal accumulation rates in both embayments are higher than in any other dated hydrothermal metalliferous sediments with the exception of those in the Atlantis II Deep of the Red Sea. Sediment ponding in the embayments is the principal cause of these results.

Pockmarks are associated either with strongly destabilized sedimentary masses or with gas chimneys.

Bottom pressure and vent temperature were mainly opposite in phase, with the main fluctuations of vent temperature occurring at tidal frequencies. Although the fluctuations in atmospheric pressure were of the same order as those due to tidal pressure, the contribution of atmospheric pressure was considerably weaker at diurnal frequencies. Some sudden discontinuities in sediment temperature were recorded, at least one of these may have been caused by seismic events. Seawater temperature changes were not reflected in the sediment temperature record. Transient loadings, such as tidal loadings, barometric pressure and earth tides, may affect the pore pressure in sediments, influencing fluid expulsion and sediment temperature as a consequence. Most of the contribution to the fluctuations in sediment temperature depends on tidal loadings. Gravitational forces, in the form of earth tides, can also be involved and barometric pressure is probably responsible for long period temperature oscillations. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

On account of the possibility of the occurrence of other phenomena, such as tsunamis, the explosions driven by submarine volcanic systems are of particular interest, although little investigated. The recent sudden increase in the degassing activity of the submarine geothermal system of Panarea Island (Aeolian arc), has allowed us to better understand the way in which the quiet degassing activity of a submarine hydrothermal system may develop if new magma or magmatic gases feed it. We focused our investigations on the crater-shaped area where the volcanic crisis started, with the aim of evaluating whether the crater was formed by an explosive event or by sediment erosion due to the intense gas flow rate. The calculated energetic conditions, coupled with the computed physic-chemical state of the fluids at the level of the deep reservoir, provided the theoretical boundary conditions of the occurred event, while suggesting that a low-energy explosion was responsible for producing the crater at the sea bottom.

In the present study, the microbial communities of three carbonate crust samples from deep-sea mud volcanoes in the eastern Mediterranean were characterized by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes amplified from DNA directly retrieved from the samples. In combination with the mineralogical composition of the crusts and lipid analyses, sequence data were used to assess the possible role of prokaryotes in crust formation. Collectively, the obtained data showed the presence of highly diverse communities, which were distinct in each of the carbonate crusts studied. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were found in all crusts and the majority was classified as Î±-, Î³-, and Î´- Proteobacteria. Interestingly, sequences of Proteobacteria related to Halomonas and Halovibrio sp., which can play an active role in carbonate mineral formation, were present in all crusts. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from two of the crusts studied. Several of those were closely related to archaeal sequences of organisms that have previously been linked to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). However, the majority of archaeal sequences were not related to sequences of organisms known to be involved in AOM. In combination with the strongly negative Î´ 13C values of archaeal lipids, these results open the possibility that organisms with a role in AOM may be more diverse within the Archaea than previously suggested.

In combination with the mineralogical composition of the crusts and lipid analyses, sequence data were used to assess the possible role of prokaryotes in crust formation. Collectively, the obtained data showed the presence of highly diverse communities, which were distinct in each of the carbonate crusts studied. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were found in all crusts and the majority was classified as Î±-, Î³-, and Î´- Proteobacteria. Interestingly, sequences of Proteobacteria related to Halomonas and Halovibrio sp., which can play an active role in carbonate mineral formation, were present in all crusts. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from two of the crusts studied. Several of those were closely related to archaeal sequences of organisms that have previously been linked to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). However, the majority of archaeal sequences were not related to sequences of organisms known to be involved in AOM. In combination with the strongly negative Î´ 13C values of archaeal lipids, these results open the possibility that organisms with a role in AOM may be more diverse within the Archaea than previously suggested. Different communities found in the crusts could carry out similar processes that might play a role in carbonate crust formation.

It has been investigated during the NAUTINIL (2003) and MIMES (2004) cruises carried out within the MEDIFLUX project. Active, gas-rich fluid venting occurs at the Isis mud volcano as indicated by enhanced gas content in the sediments, having a measured 7.5Â mmol of methane per liter of wet sediment in the central area of the mud volcano. In addition, gas bubble expulsions have resulted in the formation of multiple hydrocarbon plumes in the water column, with methane concentrations as high as 1550Â nmol/L, compared to âˆ¼ 1Â nmol/L for background levels in deep water. In view of the stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of methane (Î´13C = - 55.1â€° VPDB, Î´D = - 203â€° VSMOW) and of higher hydrocarbons (Î´13C of - 30.3â€°, - 26.1â€°, - 28.4â€°, and - 25.0â€° VPDB, for ethane, propane, i-butane and n-butane, respectively), their origin is mainly thermogenic. These isotopic data also show that the wet compounds are co-generated with oil and we suggest they predominantly originate from type II kerogen source rocks of potentially variable maturity levels. At the centre of the mud volcano, the distinct kink observed in the pore water isotopic and dissolved species composition and its depth level change between subsequent cruises indicates a high frequency of fluid/gas expulsion. The seawater signature of the pore fluid in the upper part of the sediment column suggests that each expulsion is followed by a downward migration of overlying seawater. Such downward advection of bottom seawater may not only be related to the replacement of the ejected gas but also to the replacement of lower density pore fluid by bottom seawater. This mechanism is thought to be a common feature at mud volcanoes and gas seepage sites. In the peripheral zone, pore fluid is at seawater concentration and isotopic composition, down to a coring depth of 430Â cmbsf. We suggest that the deeper downward advection of bottom seawater is related to the less frequent fluid/gas expulsion occurring at these sites compared to the centre sites. In this paper we show that a combination of geochemical tools used for hydrocarbons and pore water geochemistry is a powerful approach to detect sources of ascending fluid and to reveal post-eruptional fluidodynamic processes within mud volcanoes.

The most active parts of the mud volcanoes were highly gas-saturated (methane concentrations in the water and in the sediments, respectively, of several hundreds of nmol/L and several mmol/L of wet sediment) and associated with significantly high thermal gradients (at 10 m below the seafloor, the recorded temperatures reached more than 40 Â°C). Patches of highly reduced blackish sediments, mats of sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, and precipitates of authigenic carbonate were detected, indicative of anaerobic methane consumption. The chemosynthetic fauna was, however, not very abundant, inhibited most likely by the high and vigorous fluxes, and was associated mainly with carbonate-crust-covered seafloor encountered on the southwestern flank of Amon. Mud expulsions are not very common at present and were found limited to the most active emission centres of two mud volcanoes, where slow extrusion of mud occurs. Each of the mud volcanoes is fed principally by a main narrow channel located below the most elevated areas, most commonly in the centres of the structures. The distribution, shape, and seafloor morphology of the mud volcanoes and associated seeps over the Central Nile Deep Sea Fan are clearly tectonically controlled. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem-scale validation of predictions that these important groups of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of pCO2. Sea-grass production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 (1,827 Î¼atm pCO2) where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub-saturation. The species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high concentrations of pCO2 and indicate that ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non-native algal species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are removed owing to ocean acidification.

Geochemical modelling of the storage capacity for CO2 in saline aquifers, sandstones and/or carbonates should be based on natural analogues both in situ and in the laboratory. The main focus of this paper has been to study natural gas emissions representing extremely attractive surrogates for the study and prediction of the possible consequences of leakage from geological sequestration sites of anthropogenic CO2 (i.e., the return to surface, potentially causing localised environmental problems). These include a comparison among three different Italian case histories: (i) the Solfatara crater (Phlegraean Fields caldera, southern Italy) is an ancient Roman spa. The area is characterised by intense and diffuse hydrothermal activity, testified by hot acidic mud pools, thermal springs and a large fumarolic field. Soil gas flux measurements show that the entire area discharges between 1200 and 1500 tons of CO2 per day; (ii) the Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) where a huge submarine volcanic-hydrothermal gas burst occurred in November, 2002. The submarine gas emissions chemically modified seawater causing a strong modification of the marine ecosystem. All of the collected gases are CO2-dominant (maximum value: 98.43 vol.%); (iii) the Tor Caldara area (Central Italy), located in a peripheral sector of the quiescent Alban Hills volcano, along the faults of the Ardea Basin transfer structure. The area is characterised by huge CO2 degassing both from water and soil. Although the above mentioned areas do not represent a storage scenario, these sites do provide many opportunities to study near-surface processes and to test monitoring methodologies.

Our approach combines in situ seafloor observation, geophysics, sedimentological data, measurement of bottom-water methane anomalies, pore-water and sediment geochemistry, and 230Th/U dating of authigenic carbonates. Two areas were investigated, which correspond to different sedimentary provinces. The lower slope, at âˆ¼ 2100Â m water depth, indicates deformation of sediments by gravitational processes, exhibiting slope-parallel elongated ridges and seafloor depressions. In contrast, the middle slope, at âˆ¼ 1650Â m water depth, exhibits a series of debris-flow deposits not remobilized by post-depositional gravity processes. Significant differences exist between fluid-escape structures from the two studied areas. At the lower slope, methane anomalies were detected in bottom-waters above the depressions, whereas the adjacent ridges show a frequent coverage of fractured carbonate pavements associated with chemosynthetic vent communities. Carbonate U/Th age dates (âˆ¼ 8Â kyr BP), pore-water sulphate and solid phase sediment data suggest that seepage activity at those carbonate ridges has decreased over the recent past. In contrast, large (âˆ¼ 1Â km2) carbonate-paved areas were discovered in the middle slope, with U/Th isotope evidence for ongoing carbonate precipitation during the Late Holocene (since âˆ¼ 5Â kyr BP at least). Our results suggest that fluid venting is closely related to sediment deformation in the Central Nile margin. It is proposed that slope instability leads to focused fluid flow in the lower slope and exposure of 'fossil' carbonate ridges, whereas pervasive diffuse flow prevails at the unfailed middle slope.

The architecture and main sedimentary processes acting within the apron are depicted through the integration of geophysical evidence (multibeam, long-range side scan sonar and seismic data) and seafloor sampling. The apron shows, on the whole, a large variability both across and along slope of morphologies and deposits related to mass-wasting and reworking processes, passing into areas covered by hemipelagic sedimentation. A large spectrum of erosive-depositional features was recognized on the surface of the apron. On shallower areas (i.e. submerged shelves, shore platforms and depositional terraces), submarine features related to wave action and sea-level fluctuations are present; they mainly act as temporary storing and reworking areas for volcaniclastic material derived from subaerial portions. Unconfined cohesionless inertial flows commonly dominate the upper slope, where gradients are very high (up to 35Â°) and grain-to-grain and grain-to-bed collisions are favoured within the flows. These flows tend to evolve into turbidity currents on the lower slope, in response to a marked decrease of slope gradients below âˆ¼ 8Â°, generating various erosive-depositional features, such as erosive furrows, troughs, channel-levee features and coarse-grained sediment waves. The most active area of the apron lies offshore Sciara del Fuoco (on the NW flank), where a large amount of coarse-grained volcaniclastic material, derived by the persistent Strombolian activity, is collected and deposited by means of high- and low-density turbidity currents on the lower slope down to 2600 m bsl, more than 20 km far from the island. Conversely, other areas are mostly dominated by deposition via settling of suspended sediments, related both to hemipelagic sedimentation and to the dispersion of fine tephras by the prevailing wind and marine currents. Such processes interfinger and overlie in space and time, giving rise to a very complex morpho-sedimentary facies distribution. However, the structural bilateral symmetry of Stromboli volcano allows defining distinct morpho-sedimentary zones, where one (or more) type of processes dominates, and related different stratal architecture of the apron. The unbuttressed portions of the island (NW and SE) are characterized by the emplacement of wide and thick debris avalanche deposits (volume in the order of 1-2 km3 for each event) related to large-scale sector collapses, representing the most important and efficient mass-wasting processes making up the apron. Such deposits are embedded within different volcaniclastic sequences and can be eroded or exhumed by successive gravity flows. The result is a highly complex (both spatially and vertically) succession of facies, where it is often difficult to depict an arranged series of processes. Conversely, on buttressed flanks (SW and NE) a more ordered evolution of processes and deposits making up the apron is observed, giving rise to a less complex apron architecture.

This active zone has already been surveyed and revealed evidence of active seeping on the seafloor, such as bubble emissions, patches of reduced sediments, microbial mats and authigenic carbonate crusts. MarNaut was the first opportunity to sample benthic communities in the three most common microhabitats (bioturbated and reduced sediments, carbonate crust) and to examine their relationships with environmental conditions. To do so, faunal communities were sampled and chemical measurements were taken close to the organisms. According to diversity indices, the bioturbated microhabitat exhibited the highest taxonomic diversity and evenness despite a lower number of samples. Conversely, the reduced sediment microhabitat exhibited the lowest taxonomic diversity and evenness. The carbonate crust microhabitat was intermediate although it had the highest biomass. Multivariate analyses showed that (1) fauna were relatively similar within a single microhabitat; (2) faunal community structure varied greatly between the different microhabitats; (3) there was a link between faunal distribution and the type of substratum; and (4) chemical gradients (i.e. methane, oxygen and probably sulphides) may influence faunal distribution. The estimated fluid flow velocity (0.4-0.8. m/yr) confirmed the presence of fluid emission and provided evidence of seawater convection in the two soft-sediment microhabitats. Our results suggest that the reduced sediments may represent a harsher environment with high upward fluid flow, which restrains seawater from penetrating the sediments and inhibits sulphide production, whereas bioturbated sediments can be viewed as a bio-irrigated system with sulphide production occurring at greater depths. Therefore, the environmental conditions in reduced sediments appear to prevent the colonization of symbiont-bearing fauna, such as vesicomyid bivalves, which are more often found in bioturbated sediments.

This active zone has already been surveyed and revealed evidence of active seeping on the seafloor, such as bubble emissions, patches of reduced sediments, microbial mats and authigenic carbonate crusts. MarNaut was the first opportunity to sample benthic communities in the three most common microhabitats (bioturbated and reduced sediments, carbonate crust) and to examine their relationships with environmental conditions. To do so, faunal communities were sampled and chemical measurements were taken close to the organisms. According to diversity indices, the bioturbated microhabitat exhibited the highest taxonomic diversity and evenness despite a lower number of samples. Conversely, the reduced sediment microhabitat exhibited the lowest taxonomic diversity and evenness. The carbonate crust microhabitat was intermediate although it had the highest biomass. Multivariate analyses showed that (1) fauna were relatively similar within a single microhabitat; (2) faunal community structure varied greatly between the different microhabitats; (3) there was a link between faunal distribution and the type of substratum; and (4) chemical gradients (i.e. methane, oxygen and probably sulphides) may influence faunal distribution. The estimated fluid flow velocity (0.4-0.8. m/yr) confirmed the presence of fluid emission and provided evidence of seawater convection in the two soft-sediment microhabitats. Our results suggest that the reduced sediments may represent a harsher environment with high upward fluid flow, which restrains seawater from penetrating the sediments and inhibits sulphide production, whereas bioturbated sediments can be viewed as a bio-irrigated system with sulphide production occurring at greater depths. Therefore, the environmental conditions in reduced sediments appear to prevent the colonization of symbiont-bearing fauna, such as vesicomyid bivalves, which are more often found in bioturbated sediments. Fluid flow appears to control sulphide availability, which in turn influences the horizontal and vertical distribution patterns of fauna at small spatial scales as observed at other seep sites.

A novel approach is to use areas where natural release of CO 2 is present as 'field-laboratories' for validation of CO 2 monitoring techniques and procedures. One such area was identifi ed close to the volcanic island of Panarea (Italy). Here, CO 2 seeps from the seafl oor in shallow water allowing scuba divers to collect the needed data. Moreover, the coastal setting allows use of small boats for the marine operations, thus strongly reducing the costs. The applied study techniques examined are mainly sampling methods for free and dissolved gases, direct measurement of the CO 2 fl uxes, pH measurement along the water column, and verifi cation of the impact of CO 2 on the local environment. From these fi rst results, the submarine degassing area of Panarea can be realistically considered a natural laboratory where it is possible to test and validate detection methods for the prompt identifi cation of potential seepage from sub-seabed CO 2 storage areas. The particularly favorable environment permits the use of simplifi ed logistics, thus reducing the costs of the research to almost negligible values if compared with any high-seas operation.

We conducted high temporal resolution pH and temperature measurements in and around a shallow (2.5-3m) CO2 vent site off Ischia, Italy in May and June 2008. Loggers were deployed at five stations to monitor water at both the surface and benthos. Our reference station, 500m from the CO2 vent, had no noticeable vent influence. It had a naturally high and stable benthic pH (mean 8.16, inter-quartile range (IQ): 8.14-8.18) fluctuating with diel periodicity, presumably driven by community photosynthesis and respiration. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the pH of this station was well constrained by meteorological parameters. In contrast, a station positioned within the vent zone, had a low and very variable benthic mean pH of 7.11 (IQ: 6.91-7.62) with large pH fluctuations not well constrained by a PCA. Any stations positioned within 20m of the main vent zone had lowered pH, but suffered from abnormally large pH fluctuations making them unsuitable representatives to predict future changes to a shallow coastal environment. Between these extremes, we identified a benthic area with a lower pH of 7.84 (IQ: 7.83-7.88) that retained many of the characteristics of the reference station such as a natural diel pH periodicity and low variability. Our results indicate that a range of pH environments maybe commonplace near CO2 vents due to their characteristic acidification of benthic water over a wide area. Such environments could become invaluable natural laboratories for ocean acidification research, closely mimicking future CO2 conditions in a natural setting.

The few experiments to date have been short-term (&lt;1year) and reveal mixed responses depending on the species examined and the culture conditions used. It is difficult to carry out long-term manipulations of CO2 levels, therefore areas with naturally high CO2 levels are being used to help understand which species, habitats and processes are resilient to the effects of ocean acidification, and which are adversely affected. Here we describe the effects of increasing CO2 levels on macroalgal communities along a pH gradient caused by volcanic vents.Macroalgal habitat differed at taxonomic and morphological group levels along a pH gradient. The vast majority of the 101 macroalgal species studied were able to grow with only a 5% decrease in species richness as the mean pH fell from 8.1 to 7.8. However, this small fall in species richness was associated with shifts in community structure as the cover of turf algae decreased disproportionately. Calcitic species were significantly reduced in cover and species richness whereas a few non-calcified species became dominant. At mean pH 6.7, where carbonate saturation levels were &lt;1, calcareous species were absent and there was a 72% fall in species richness. Under these extremely high CO2 conditions a few species dominated the simplified macroalgal assemblage and a very few exhibited enhanced reproduction, although high CO2 levels seemed to inhibit reproduction in others.Our data show that many macroalgal species are tolerant of long-term elevations in CO2 levels but that macroalgal habitats are altered significantly as pH drops, contributing to a scant but growing body of evidence concerning the long-term effects of CO2 emissions in vegetated marine systems. Further study is now needed to investigate whether the observed response of macroalgal communities can be replicated in different seasons and from a range of geographical regions for incorporation into global modelling studies to predict effects of CO2 emissions on Earth's ecosystems.

However there are concerns related to the possibility of leakage from the storage sites and potential consequences on the marine environment. In order to develop safe and reliable methods for CO2 monitoring, field studies were conducted in a natural analogue - an area where there is a natural release of CO2 from the seafloor. Due to the very high volume of gas emitted, this natural analogue could be considered as the worst-case scenario for a possible leakage from a sub-seabed storage site. Sampling procedures for free and dissolved gas and measuring techniques of the main physical and chemical parameters were developed for use both from the surface and directly underwater by scientific scuba divers. The first results of the research indicate that high levels of CO2 released in the marine realm strongly affect the local environmental conditions with a generalized acidification of the seawater. The experience gained in this study allows further development of a more accurate and suitable monitoring suite that will integrate sensors for measuring pH, dissolved CO2, and eventually, acoustic systems for the detection, monitoring and quantification of gas bubbles. The monitoring system could be deployed on the seafloor for long-term monitoring or could be carried onboard movable platforms such as ROV's (Remote Operated Vehicles) or AUV's (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) for systematic surveys of the sub-seabed storage areas.

Based on high-resolution morphobathymetric data and chirp-sonar seismic reflection profiles we selected three areas with different tectonic features associated to the NAF system, where we performed visual and instrumental seafloor inspections, including in situ measurements of dissolved CH 4, and sampling of the bottom water. Starting from background values of 2-10 nM, methane concentration in the bottom seawater increases abruptly up to 20 nM over the main NAF trace. CH4 concentration peaks up to âˆ¼120 nM were detected above mounds related probably to gas and fluids expulsion. Methane is microbial (Î´13CCH4: -67.3 and -76% versus VPDB), and was found mainly associated with pre-Holocene deposits topped by a 10-20 m thick draping of marine mud. The correlation between tectonic structures and gas-seepages at the seafloor suggests that the NAF in the Gulf of Ä°zmit could represent a key site for long-term combined monitoring of fluid exhalations and seismicity to assess their potential as earthquake precursors.

Our observations of enhanced productivity with pCO 2, which are consistent with previous reports for some calcifying corals, convey an increase in fitness that may enable non-calcifying anthozoans to thrive in future environments, i.e. higher seawater pCO 2.

Here we investigated the sources of hydrocarbon gases and sedimentary organic matter together with biomarkers of microbial activity at four locations of NAMV to constrain how venting at the seafloor relates to the generation of hydrocarbon gases in deeper sediments. At the centre, high upward flux of hot (70Â°C) hydrocarbon-rich fluids is indicated by an absence of biomarkers of Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) and nearly constant methane (CH 4) concentration depth-profile. The presence of lipids of incompatible thermal maturities points to mixing between early-mature petroleum and immature organic matter, indicating that shallow mud has been mobilized by the influx of deep-sourced hydrocarbon-rich fluids. Methane is enriched in the heavier isotopes, with values of Î´ 13C~-46.6â€° VPDB and Î´D ~-228â€° VSMOW, and is associated with high amounts of heavier homologues (C 2+) suggesting a co-genetic origin with the petroleum.On the contrary at the periphery, a lower but sustained CH 4 flux is indicated by deeper sulphate-methane transition zones and the presence of 13C-depleted biomarkers of AOM, consistent with predominantly immature organic matter. Values of Î´ 13C-CH 4~-60â€° VPDB and decreased concentrations of 13C-enriched C 2+ are typical of mixed microbial CH 4 and biodegraded thermogenic gas from Plio-Pleistocene reservoirs of the region. The maturity of gas condensate migrated from pre-Miocene sources into Miocene reservoirs of the Western NDSF is higher than that of the gas vented at the centre of NAMV, supporting the hypothesis that it is rather released from the degradation of oil in Neogene reservoirs. Combined with the finding of hot pore water and petroleum at the centre, our results suggest that clay mineral dehydration of Neogene sediments, which takes place posterior to reservoir filling, may contribute to intense gas generation at high sedimentation rate deltas.

However, despite ease of access, much less is known about the geochemical dynamics of these ecosystems. Here, we report on the spatial and temporal geochemical dynamics of a shallow-water vent system at Paleochori Bay, Milos Island, Greece. Our multi-analyte voltammetric profiles of dissolved O2 and hydrothermal tracers (e.g. Fe2+, FeSaq, Mn2+) on sediment cores taken along a transection in hydrothermally affected sediments indicate three different areas: the central vent area (highest temperature) with a deeper penetration of oxygen into the sediment, and a lack of dissolved Fe2+ and Mn2+; a middle area (0.5m away) rich in dissolved Fe2+ and Mn2+ (exceeding 2mM) and high free sulfide with potential for microbial sulfide oxidation as suggested by the presence of white mats at the sediment surface; and, finally, an outer rim area (1-1.5m away) with lower concentrations of Fe2+ and Mn2+ and higher signals of FeSaq, indicating an aged hydrothermal fluid contribution. In addition, high-frequency temperature series and continuous in situ H2S measurements with voltammetric sensors over a 6-day time period at a distance 0.5m away from the vent center showed substantial variability in temperature (31.6 to 46.4Â°C) and total sulfide (488 to 1329Î¼M) in the upper sediment layer. The analysis of these data suggests that tidal and wind forcing, and abrupt geodynamic events generate intermittent mixing conditions lasting for several hours to days. Despite substantial variability, the concentration of sulfide available for chemoautotrophic microbes remained high. However, the availability of electron acceptors originating from seawater might be more intermittent, which in turn has an effect on the reestablishment of the white mats after wave-induced disturbances. Our results emphasize the importance of transient events in the development of chemoautotrophic communities in the hydrothermally influenced sediments of Paleochori Bay.

In the sediment cores, carbonate concretions are concentrated at the lacustrine-to-marine transition, which corresponds to the period when Mediterranean waters flowed into the Marmara Basin about 12-14 kyr ago. U-Th isotopic data indicate that most of these concretions formed later during the Holocene, around 9-10 kyr ago, a period coinciding with an important anoxic event that led to the deposition of a sapropel layer in the Sea of Marmara.Based upon these results, we suggest that the absence of carbonate concretions in the lacustrine sediment unit indicates that dissolved sulfate concentrations in the Marmara lake pore waters during glacial time were too low to promote significant anaerobic methane oxidation, thereby preventing sedimentary carbonate authigenesis. In contrast, the progressive inflow of Mediterranean waters into the glacial Marmara lake after 15 ka provided a source of dissolved sulfate that allowed anaerobic oxidation of methane to proceed within the anoxic sediment. Importantly, the synchronism between the main phase of authigenic carbonate precipitation at the studied sites (average 9.4 Â± 1.8 ka, n = 16) and the regional anoxic sapropel event support the idea that the drop in bottom water dissolved oxygen content was probably a key factor to enhance microbial activity and associated carbonate precipitation at that time.

In the sediment cores, carbonate concretions are concentrated at the lacustrine-to-marine transition, which corresponds to the period when Mediterranean waters flowed into the Marmara Basin about 12-14 kyr ago. U-Th isotopic data indicate that most of these concretions formed later during the Holocene, around 9-10 kyr ago, a period coinciding with an important anoxic event that led to the deposition of a sapropel layer in the Sea of Marmara.Based upon these results, we suggest that the absence of carbonate concretions in the lacustrine sediment unit indicates that dissolved sulfate concentrations in the Marmara lake pore waters during glacial time were too low to promote significant anaerobic methane oxidation, thereby preventing sedimentary carbonate authigenesis. In contrast, the progressive inflow of Mediterranean waters into the glacial Marmara lake after 15 ka provided a source of dissolved sulfate that allowed anaerobic oxidation of methane to proceed within the anoxic sediment. Importantly, the synchronism between the main phase of authigenic carbonate precipitation at the studied sites (average 9.4 Â± 1.8 ka, n = 16) and the regional anoxic sapropel event support the idea that the drop in bottom water dissolved oxygen content was probably a key factor to enhance microbial activity and associated carbonate precipitation at that time. Overall, these results provide straightforward evidence that fluid emission dynamics and hydrocarbon oxidation at cold seeps can be directly related to changing environmental conditions through time.

In order to understand the effect of acidification on algal community development, early colonization stages were investigated using carbon dioxide vents around the Castello Aragonese (Ischia, Italy) as a natural laboratory. Settlement tiles were placed in zones with different pH (normal, medium and low), and species composition and coverage measured after 2, 3 and 4 months of deployment. The number of species decreased by 4 and 18 % at medium and low pH zones, respectively (P < 0.05). The structure of the algal assemblage differed between pH zones during the 4 months of the experiment, due to the addition and/or replacement of new species. This leads to a change in the succession of morphological forms as soft crustose algae replaced calcareous species, and turf species were dominant in cover; more complex thalli started to occur only at medium pH. These results support previous findings that ocean acidification will induce changes in benthic algal communities.

Screening of lipase activity was performed both in agar plates and liquid cultures using olive oil as carbon source. Significant differences were observed between the two screening methods with no clear correlation between them. While the percentage of lipase producing strains identified in agar plates was only 17%, lipolytic activity in liquid culture supernatants was detected for 74% of them. Nine strains exhibiting elevated extracellular lipase activities were selected for lipase production and biochemical characterization. The majority of lipase producers revealed high phylogenetic similarity with Geobacillus species and related genera, whilst one of them was identified as Aneurinibacillus sp. Lipase biosynthesis strongly depended on the carbon source that supplemented the culture medium. Olive oil induced lipase production in all strains, but maximum enzyme yields for some of the strains were also obtained with Tween-80, mineral oil, and glycerol. Partially purified lipases revealed optimal activity at 70-80Â°C and pH 8-9. Extensive thermal stability studies revealed marked thermostability for the majority of the lipases as well as a two-step thermal deactivation pattern. Â© 2013 Panagiota M.

Its discharge from shallow-sea hydrothermal vents into coastal marine environments can dramatically affect the surrounding ecosystems. Shallow-sea hydrothermal venting of acidic (pH~5), hot (40-116Â°C), and highly sulfidic (up to 3.1mM H2S) fluids occurs at Palaeochori and Spathi Bays, off the southeast coast of Milos Island, Greece. Two distinct types of fluids, both extremely As enriched, were collected from the submarine vents often within a few meters of each other: (1) a high-Cl fluid (enriched in Cl by up to 47% relative to seawater) depleted in Mg and SO4 and enriched in major (Na, Ca, K, B, Sr, and Br) and minor/trace elements (Si, Li, Rb, Ce, As, Fe, Mn, and Ba), and (2) a low-Cl fluid (depleted in Cl by up to 66% relative to seawater) also depleted in Na, Mg, SO4, and Br. The maximum concentration of As reached 39Î¼M in the high-Cl fluids and up to 78Î¼M in the low-Cl fluids. This is approximately 3000 times the concentration of As in seawater and far exceeds the concentrations typically found in mid-ocean ridge (MOR) and back-arc basin (BAB) fluids, which are typically &lt;0.7 and &lt;10Î¼M, respectively.We used a combination of elemental analyses and stable and radiogenic isotope data (oxygen, deuterium, and strontium) to understand the primary controls on As enrichment. Those parameters all indicated that the fluids were a mixture of seawater and a hydrothermal fluid originally derived from seawater but altered by water-rock interaction, subcritical phase separation (boiling), and vapor/brine segregation. Since As was extremely enriched in both the high-Cl and the low-Cl thermal fluids, we conclude that this element readily partitions into the vapor phase in the Milos hydrothermal system. The original source of As is most likely the leaching of the greenschist facies metamorphic basement rocks transpierced by an abundance of secondary quartz and calcite veins rich in pyrite. It is possible that these veins were deposited from As-rich magmatic fluids, similar to some epithermal Au deposits. A poorly-crystalline orpiment precipitates as hydrothermal fluids mix with overlying seawater, and removes much of the dissolved As prior to discharge.

However, some species and life stages may be capable of thriving in low pH conditions, either due to their natural ability to tolerate stressful low pHâ€“high pCO2 conditions and/or alteration of species interactions caused by changes in pH profiles, or due to evolutionary trade-offs. A better understanding of which species may be capable of tolerating ocean acidification can guide future research into the mechanisms for physiological and ecological resilience to future carbon dioxide (CO2) conditions. We investigated the colonization of selected polychaete species along a pH gradient originating from shallow, coastal volcanic CO2 vents (Ischia, Italy). Colonization was quantified by exposing artificial invertebrate collectors attached to the substratum for 30Â days during different periods of the year (late spring, fall and late winter). Three species, Amphiglena mediterranea, Platynereis dumerilii and Syllis prolifera, were present and abundant along the gradient throughout the year. All three species were significantly more abundant in the most acidified areas, confirming their high tolerance and capacity to cope with very low pH. Abundances of all three species were compared to data previously collected via collectors suspended in the water column. More individuals were found in the collectors attached to the substratum, suggesting that abundances may have previously been underestimated. This is likely due to the close proximity of these collectors with the natural rocky substratum. All three species exhibited similar temporal variability, consistent with their life cycle and reproductive biology. Our results demonstrate high tolerance of the species for low and variable pH and corroborate their use as robust models to explore the capacity to cope with low pHâ€“high pCO2 conditions, both in the natural vent systems and in the laboratory.

Responses of biological communities to increases in carbon dioxide can be assessed at CO2seeps that cause chronic exposure to lower seawater pH over localised areas of seabed. Shifts in macroalgal communities have been described at temperate and tropical pCO2seeps, but temporal and spatial replication of these observations is needed to strengthen confidence our predictions, especially because very few studies have been replicated between seasons. Here we describe the seawater chemistry and seasonal variability of macroalgal communities at CO2seeps off Methana (Aegean Sea). Monitoring from 2011 to 2013 showed that seawater pH decreased to levels predicted for the end of this century at the seep site with no confounding gradients in Total Alkalinity, salinity, temperature or wave exposure. Most nutrient levels were similar along the pH gradient; silicate increased significantly with decreasing pH, but it was not limiting for algal growth at all sites. Metal concentrations in seaweed tissues varied between sites but did not consistently increase with pCO2. Our data on the flora are consistent with results from laboratory experiments and observations at Mediterranean CO2seep sites in that benthic communities decreased in calcifying algal cover and increased in brown algal cover with increasing pCO2. This differs from the typical macroalgal community response to stress, which is a decrease in perennial brown algae and proliferation of opportunistic green algae. Cystoseira corniculata was more abundant in autumn and Sargassum vulgare in spring, whereas the articulated coralline alga Jania rubens was more abundant at reference sites in autumn.

Shifts in macroalgal communities have been described at temperate and tropical pCO2seeps, but temporal and spatial replication of these observations is needed to strengthen confidence our predictions, especially because very few studies have been replicated between seasons. Here we describe the seawater chemistry and seasonal variability of macroalgal communities at CO2seeps off Methana (Aegean Sea). Monitoring from 2011 to 2013 showed that seawater pH decreased to levels predicted for the end of this century at the seep site with no confounding gradients in Total Alkalinity, salinity, temperature or wave exposure. Most nutrient levels were similar along the pH gradient; silicate increased significantly with decreasing pH, but it was not limiting for algal growth at all sites. Metal concentrations in seaweed tissues varied between sites but did not consistently increase with pCO2. Our data on the flora are consistent with results from laboratory experiments and observations at Mediterranean CO2seep sites in that benthic communities decreased in calcifying algal cover and increased in brown algal cover with increasing pCO2. This differs from the typical macroalgal community response to stress, which is a decrease in perennial brown algae and proliferation of opportunistic green algae.

This is particularly true for Eastern Mediterranean sapropels where seawater stratification is regarded as a major driving force for oxygen depletion, but in which sulphidic (euxinic) bottom waters occur only sporadically. Here we apply a powerful array of geochemical proxies (Fe and Mo stable isotopes together with Mo/U ratios and redox sensitive trace elements (RSTE)) to the determination of water redox evolution during the deposition of Holocene S1 sapropel and its underlying and overlying sediments (ODP core 967D; 2550 m depth).RSTE are asymmetrically distributed within the sapropel, with peak enrichments occurring in its lower (early) part. Negative correlations are found between Î´Fe57 and both Fe/Al and S wt% in the lower sapropel, and are consistent with the benthic Fe shuttle model Fe enrichment in euxinic basins. MoEF/UEF enrichment factor variations show well defined trends identical to those proposed for open marine settings, in which sub-oxic conditions in the background sediments give way to sulphidic waters at the RSTE peak in the lower sapropel. The most notable features of the Mo isotope profile are 'atypically' light values (Î´Mo98/95&lt;-0.7â€°) in the lower sapropel. Such light Mo isotope values (relative to sea water Î´Mo98/95=2.3â€°) have been related to oxic remobilisation. However, negative correlations between Î´Mo98/95 and Fe/Al, Ba/Al, Mo/Al and S imply that the lowest Mo isotopic compositions are associated with peak reducing conditions. Taken in conjunction with the evidence from the other proxies for a sulphidic water column, the light Mo isotope values in the lower sapropel are best explained by a large isotopic fractionation between sea water molybdate and thiomolybdate species in mildly euxinic bottom waters ([H2S]aq &lt;10 Î¼M). The data from this study thus show that hitherto unrecognised euxinic conditions occur during the early stages of deposition of the Holocene sapropel S1. Molybdenum isotopes and Ba/Al ratios identify a short-lived sapropel re-ventilation event timed to coincide with the 8.2 ka cold climatic Event.

ADCP current-meters were deployed during the paroxysmal phase in 2002 and 2003 a few meters from the degassing vent, recording day-long time series. Datasets were sorted to remove errors and select good quality ensembles over the entire water column. Standard deviation of error velocity was considered a proxy for inhomogeneous velocity fields over beams. Time series intervals had been selected when the basic ADCP assumptions were fulfilled and random errors minimized. Backscatter data were also processed to identify bubbles in the water column with the aim of locating bubble-free ensembles. Reliable time series are selected combining these data. Two possible scenarios have been described: firstly, a highly dynamic situation with visible surface diverging rings of waves, entrainment on the lower part of the gas column, detrainment in the upper part and a stagnation line (SL) at mid depth where currents were close to zero and most of the gas bubbles spread laterally; secondly, a less dynamic situation with water entraining into the gas plume at all depths and no surface rings of diverging waves. Reasons for these different dynamics may be ascribed to changes in gas fluxes (one order of magnitude higher in 2002). Description of SL is important to quantify its position in the water column and timing for entrainment-detrainment, and it can be measured by ADCP and calculated from models.

In situ nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometry, pH measurements, and onboard membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) were used to determine the fate of rising CO2 bubbles and the dissolved CO2 plume patterns in a 300 Ã— 400-m working area. The In situ sensor carrier platform, a towed video-controlled water sampling rosette, equipped with CTD sensors, guaranteed excellent ground truthing of seafloor characteristics and bubble discharge. Sensor data and near-seafloor observations indicated that the gas bubbles (&lt;9 mm in diameter, &gt;97 vol.% of CO2) dissolved very rapidly within the first 10 m above seafloor. Bottom water masses enriched with pCO2 (up to 1,100 Î¼atm) show low pH values (up to 7.80) and tend to spread rather downslope west than following the measured weak current in SSE-SSW direction. The 3-D evaluation of pCO2plume is a valuable tool to back-trace the origin of CO2 leakage when compared with local current regimes, water column CTD data, and seafloor bathymetry. Seep sites offshore Panarea can be used for studying CO2 leakage behavior and testing measuring strategies in shallow waters. Moreover, this area is a naturally designed laboratory to improve existing physicochemical and oceanographic transport models for subsea CO2 leakage. Â© 2015 Marine Technology Society Inc.

Amiata in the Tyrrhenian pre-Apennine volcanic district of Southern Tuscany. A new target for geothermal exploration and exploitation in Italy is represented by the Southern Tyrrhenian submarine volcanic district, a geologically young basin (Upper Pliocene-Pleistocene) characterised by tectonic extension where many seamounts have developed. Heat-flow data from that area show significant anomalies comparable to those of onshore geothermal fields. Fractured basaltic rocks facilitate seawater infiltration and circulation of hot water chemically altered by rock/water interactions, as shown by the widespread presence of hydrothermal deposits. The persistence of active hydrothermal activity is consistently shown by many different sources of evidence, including: heat-flow data, gravity and magnetic anomalies, widespread presence of hydrothermal-derived gases (CO2, CO, CH4), 3He/4He isotopic ratios, as well as broadband OBS/H seismological information, which demonstrates persistence of volcano-tectonic events and High Frequency Tremor (HFT). The Marsili and Tyrrhenian seamounts are thus an important - and likely long-lasting-renewable energy resource. This raises the possibility of future development of the world's first offshore geothermal power plant.

This submarine eruption has been documented mainly by historical reports, describing basaltic scoria bombs floating on the sea surface (i.e., lava balloons). In this study, the 1891 eruptive vent has been identified as a small cone (volume of âˆ¼700,000 m3) rising âˆ¼90 m from 350 m w.d., and located within a newly discovered submarine volcanic field covering a wide area offshore from the NW coast of Pantelleria; recently, Kelly et al. (2012) confirmed this location by a multibeam and ROV survey. Pyroclasts from the 1891 eruption crop out directly on the seafloor and are fresh scoria clasts (i.e., small bombs, bomb fragments, and lapilli) and glass ash-sized grains; both have been characterized in their morphology, textures, and geochemistry. The distinctive vesicularity and crystallization characteristics displayed by the scoriaceous pyroclasts reflect modes of degassing in both syn and posteruptive regimes; these characteristics, along with the distribution of deposits suggest for the strongest eruptive phase of the 1891 eruption a style analogous to Hawaiian fountaining. Glass grains from a buoyant plume were dispersed northward from the vent, up to distances of 1.5 km, redirected by the Levantine Intermediate Water. The identification of the 1891 submarine eruptive vent offshore Pantelleria, as well as the features of erupted pyroclasts improve our knowledge of submarine explosive eruptions that occur at shallow-intermediate depths and, among these, of the rare eruptions producing lava balloons.

With increasing pCO2, calcification rates of several species decrease3, although cases of upregulation are observed4. Here, we show that biological control over mineralization relates to species abundance along a natural pH gradient. As pCO2 increased, the mineralogy of a scleractinian coral (Balanophyllia europaea) and a mollusc (Vermetus triqueter) did not change. In contrast, two calcifying algae (Padina pavonica and Acetabularia acetabulum) reduced and changed mineralization with increasing pCO2, from aragonite to the less soluble calcium sulphates and whewellite, respectively. As pCO2 increased, the coral and mollusc abundance was severely reduced, with both species disappearing at pH &lt; 7.8. Conversely, the two calcifying and a non-calcifying algae (Lobophora variegata) showed less severe or no reductions with increasing pCO2, and were all found at the lowest pH site. The mineralization response to decreasing pH suggests a link with the degree of control over the biomineralization process by the organism, as only species with lower control managed to thrive in the lowest pH.

Here we evaluated the response of important parameters such as growth, mortality, oxygen consumption, and mineralization of transplanted Pinna nobilis juveniles in the naturally acidified waters of a CO2 vent system. Our field experiments show a general decrease of physiological responses of juveniles for the studied parameters along a decreasing pH gradient, even if significant effects are only observed under pH values of 7.6 units (â€œextremeâ€ pH). In particular, the mortality rate increased from 10â€“30Â % over the study period at control conditions to 60â€“70Â % at extreme pH values. We conclude that near-future decreases in pH (decreases of 0.3â€“0.5 pH units) may not have a significant effect on performance of P. nobilis juveniles, while predicted longer-term decreases (decreases of 0.7â€“0.8 pH units) could affect the survival of the species.

Samples taken from within these acidic pools are devoid of calcifying organisms, and channel structures among the pools indicate gravity driven flow, suggesting that seafloor release of CO2 at this site may preferentially impact benthic ecosystems.

Shallow-sea vent systems, however, are understudied in this regard. In order to investigate subsurface processes in a shallow-sea hydrothermal vent, and determine how these physical and chemical parameters influence the metabolic potential of the microbial communities, three shallow-sea hydrothermal vents associated with Panarea Island (Italy) were characterized. Vent fluids, pore fluids and gases at the three sites were sampled and analyzed for major and minor elements, redox-sensitive compounds, free gas compositions, and strontium isotopes. The corresponding data were used to 1) describe the subsurface geochemical evolution of the fluids and 2) to evaluate the catabolic potential of 61 inorganic redox reactions for in situ microbial communities. Generally, the vent fluids can be hot (up to 135Â°C), acidic (pH1.9-5.7), and sulfidic (up to 2.5mM H2S). Three distinct types of hydrothermal fluids were identified, each with higher temperatures and lower pH, Mg and SO4, relative to seawater. Type 1 was consistently more saline than Type 2, and both were more saline than seawater. Type 3 fluids were similar to or slightly depleted in most major ions relative to seawater. End-member calculations of conservative elements indicate that Type 1 and Type 2 fluids are derived from two different sources, most likely 1) a deeper, higher salinity reservoir and 2) a shallower, lower salinity reservoir, respectively, in a layered hydrothermal system. The deeper reservoir records some of the highest end-member Cl concentrations to date, and developed as a result of recirculation of brine fluids with long term loss of steam and volatiles due to past phase separation. No strong evidence for ongoing phase separation is observed. Type 3 fluids are suggested to be mostly influenced by degassing of volatiles and subsequently dissolution of CO2, H2S, and other gases into the aqueous phase. Gibbs energies (Î´Gr) of redox reactions that couple potential terminal electron acceptors (O2, NO3-, MnIV, FeIII, SO42-, S0, CO2) with potential electron donors (H2, NH4+, Fe2+, Mn2+, H2S, CH4) were evaluated at in situ temperatures and compositions for each site and by fluid type. When Gibbs energies of reaction are normalized per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, sulfur oxidation reactions are the most exergonic, while the oxidation of Fe2+, NH4+, CH4, and Mn2+ is moderately energy yielding. The energetic calculations indicate that the most robust microbial communities in the Panarea hot springs combine H2S from deep water-rock-gas interactions with O2 that is entrained via seawater mixing to fuel their activities, regardless of site location or fluid type.

Shallow-sea vent systems, however, are understudied in this regard. In order to investigate subsurface processes in a shallow-sea hydrothermal vent, and determine how these physical and chemical parameters influence the metabolic potential of the microbial communities, three shallow-sea hydrothermal vents associated with Panarea Island (Italy) were characterized. Vent fluids, pore fluids and gases at the three sites were sampled and analyzed for major and minor elements, redox-sensitive compounds, free gas compositions, and strontium isotopes. The corresponding data were used to 1) describe the subsurface geochemical evolution of the fluids and 2) to evaluate the catabolic potential of 61 inorganic redox reactions for in situ microbial communities. Generally, the vent fluids can be hot (up to 135Â°C), acidic (pH1.9-5.7), and sulfidic (up to 2.5mM H2S). Three distinct types of hydrothermal fluids were identified, each with higher temperatures and lower pH, Mg and SO4, relative to seawater. Type 1 was consistently more saline than Type 2, and both were more saline than seawater. Type 3 fluids were similar to or slightly depleted in most major ions relative to seawater. End-member calculations of conservative elements indicate that Type 1 and Type 2 fluids are derived from two different sources, most likely 1) a deeper, higher salinity reservoir and 2) a shallower, lower salinity reservoir, respectively, in a layered hydrothermal system. The deeper reservoir records some of the highest end-member Cl concentrations to date, and developed as a result of recirculation of brine fluids with long term loss of steam and volatiles due to past phase separation. No strong evidence for ongoing phase separation is observed. Type 3 fluids are suggested to be mostly influenced by degassing of volatiles and subsequently dissolution of CO2, H2S, and other gases into the aqueous phase. Gibbs energies (Î´Gr) of redox reactions that couple potential terminal electron acceptors (O2, NO3-, MnIV, FeIII, SO42-, S0, CO2) with potential electron donors (H2, NH4+, Fe2+, Mn2+, H2S, CH4) were evaluated at in situ temperatures and compositions for each site and by fluid type. When Gibbs energies of reaction are normalized per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, sulfur oxidation reactions are the most exergonic, while the oxidation of Fe2+, NH4+, CH4, and Mn2+ is moderately energy yielding. The energetic calculations indicate that the most robust microbial communities in the Panarea hot springs combine H2S from deep water-rock-gas interactions with O2 that is entrained via seawater mixing to fuel their activities, regardless of site location or fluid type.

The cores were analyzed using paleomagnetic and geochemical measurements. Two sapropels are documented in the last 11 kyr and are recorded in several locations across the Marmara Sea. These two sapropels have contrasting magnetic properties. The magnetic record is affected by intense early diagenesis; the most recent upper sapropelic layer has low remanence and susceptibility values. A record of paleomagnetic inclinations could still be isolated above the diagenesis front and is compared with secular variation models. The lower sapropel is identified in the deep part of the oldest studied core (Klg07) and has distinct magnetic properties characterized by high remanence and susceptibility values. Using the magnetic properties it is possible to constrain bottom water ventilation and reconnection episodes between the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea following the sea level rise during the last glacial to inter-glacial transition.

Shifts in dominance between primary producers will have knock-on effects on marine ecosystems and will likely vary regionally, depending on factors such as irradiance (light vs. shade) and nutrient levels (oligotrophic vs. eutrophic). Thus experiments are needed to evaluate interactive effects of combined stressors in the field. In this study, we investigated the physiological responses of macroalgae near a CO2 seep in oligotrophic waters off Vulcano (Italy). The algae were incubated in situ at 0.2 m depth using a combination of three mean CO2 levels (500, 700-800 and 1200 Î¼atm CO2), two light levels (100 and 70% of surface irradiance) and two nutrient levels of N, P, and K (enriched vs. non-enriched treatments) in the non-calcified macroalga Cystoseira compressa (Phaeophyceae, Fucales) and calcified Padina pavonica (Phaeophyceae, Dictyotales). A suite of biochemical assays and in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters showed that elevated CO2 levels benefitted both of these algae, although their responses varied depending on light and nutrient availability. In C. compressa, elevated CO2 treatments resulted in higher carbon content and antioxidant activity in shaded conditions both with and without nutrient enrichment-they had more Chla, phenols and fucoxanthin with nutrient enrichment and higher quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and photosynthetic efficiency (Î±ETR) without nutrient enrichment. In P. pavonica, elevated CO2 treatments had higher carbon content, Fv/Fm, Î±ETR, and Chla regardless of nutrient levels-they had higher concentrations of phenolic compounds in nutrient enriched, fully-lit conditions and more antioxidants in shaded, nutrient enriched conditions. Nitrogen content increased significantly in fertilized treatments, confirming that these algae were nutrient limited in this oligotrophic part of the Mediterranean.

Understanding processes driving bacterial diversity, colonization and dispersal is of prime importance for deep-sea microbial ecology. This study provides a detailed characterization of bacterial assemblages colonizing plant-derived substrates using a standardized approach over a geographic area spanning the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean. Wood and alfalfa substrates in colonization devices were deployed for different periods at 8 deep-sea chemosynthesis-based sites in four distinct geographic areas. Pyrosequencing of a fragment of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene was used to describe bacterial communities. Colonization occurred within the first 14 days. The diversity was higher in samples deployed for more than 289 days. After 289 days, no relation was observed between community richness and deployment duration, suggesting that diversity may have reached saturation sometime in between. Communities in long-term deployments were different, and their composition was mainly influenced by the geographical location where devices were deployed. Numerous sequences related to horizontally-transmitted chemosynthetic symbionts of metazoans were identified. Their potential status as free-living forms of these symbionts was evaluated based on sequence similarity with demonstrated symbionts. Results suggest that some free-living forms of metazoan symbionts or their close relatives, such as Epsilonproteobacteria associated with the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata, are efficient colonizers of plant substrates at vents and seeps.

Results showed the bacterial community of the two anemone species differed significantly from each other primarily because of differences in the Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria abundances.

However the physiological mechanisms underlying this potential success are unclear. Here we investigate the impact of high pCO2 on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) use in the temperate sea anemon Anemonia viridis.We assessed the impacts of long-Termexposure to high pCO2, i.e. sampling in sit naturalCO2vents (Vulcano, Italy), and short-Termexposure, i.e. during a 3wk controlled laborator experiment. We focused on photo-physiological parameters (net photosynthesis rates, chlorophyl a content and Symbiodinium density) and on carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, an enzyme involve in the energy-demanding process of DIC absorption. Long-Term exposure to high pCO2 had n impact on Symbiodinium density and chlorophyll a content. In contrst, short-Termexposure to hig pCO2 induced a significant reduction in Symbiodinium density, which together with unchanged ne photosynthesis resulted in the increase of Symbiodinium productivity per cell. Finally, in both in sit long-Termand laboratory short-Termexposure to high pCO2, we observed a significant decrease i the CA activity of sea anemones, suggesting a change in DIC use (i.e. from an HCO ? to a CO2 user) This change could enable a shift in the energy budget that may increase the ability of non-calcifyin photosynthetic anthozoans to cope with ocean acidification.

Hydrothermal fluids are often depleted in sulfate when compared to surrounding seawater and can contain high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). It is well known that sulfur in its various oxidation states plays an important role in processing and transformation of organic matter. However, the formation and the reactivity of dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) in the water column at hydrothermal systems are so far not well understood. We investigated DOS dynamics and its relation to the physicochemical environment by studying the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in three contrasting shallow hydrothermal systems off Milos (Eastern Mediterranean), Dominica (Caribbean Sea) and Iceland (North Atlantic). We used ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to characterize the DOM on a molecular level. The molecular information was complemented with general geochemical data, quantitative dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DOS analyses as well as isotopic measurements (Î´2H, Î´18O and F14C). In contrast to the predominantly meteoric fluids from Dominica and Iceland, hydrothermal fluids from Milos were mainly fed by recirculating seawater. The hydrothermal fluids from Milos were enriched in H2S and DOS, as indicated by high DOS/DOC ratios and by the fact that &gt;90% of all assigned DOM formulas that were exclusively present in the fluids contained sulfur. In all three systems, DOS from hydrothermal fluids had on average lower O/C ratios (0.26-0.34) than surrounding surface seawater DOS (0.45-0.52), suggesting shallow hydrothermal systems as a source of reduced DOS, which will likely get oxidized upon contact with oxygenated seawater. Evaluation of hypothetical sulfurization reactions suggests DOM reduction and sulfurization during seawater recirculation in Milos seafloor. The four most effective potential sulfurization reactions were those exchanging an O atom by one S atom in the formula or the equivalent + H2S reaction, correspondingly exchanging H2O, H2 and/or O2 by a H2S molecule. Our study reveals novel insights into DOS dynamics in marine hydrothermal environments and provides a conceptual framework for molecular-scale mechanisms in organic sulfur geochemistry.

AOM is largely mediated by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and has mainly been investigated in deep-sea sediments. Here we studied methane seepage at four spots located at 12 m water depth in coastal, organic carbon depleted permeable sands off the Island of Elba (Italy). We combined biogeochemical measurements, sequencing-based community analyses and in situ hybridization to investigate the microbial communities of this environment. Increased alkalinity, formation of free sulfide and nearly stoichiometric methane oxidation and sulfate reduction rates up to 200 nmol g-1 day-1 indicated the predominance of sulfate-coupled AOM. With up to 40 cm thickness the zones of AOM activity were unusually large and occurred in deeper sediment horizons (20-50 cm below seafloor) as compared to diffusion-dominated deep-sea seeps, which is likely caused by advective flow of pore water due to the shallow water depth and permeability of the sands. Hydrodynamic forces also may be responsible for the substantial phylogenetic and unprecedented morphological diversity of AOM consortia inhabiting these sands, including the clades ANME-1a/b, ANME-2a/b/c, ANME-3, and their partner bacteria SEEP-SRB1a and SEEP-SRB2. High microbial dispersal, the availability of diverse energy sources and high habitat heterogeneity might explain that the emission spots shared few microbial taxa, despite their physical proximity. Although the biogeochemistry of this shallow methane seep was very different to that of deep-sea seeps, their key functional taxa were very closely related, which supports the global dispersal of key taxa and underlines strong selection by methane as the predominant energy source. Mesophilic, methane-fueled ecosystems in shallow-water permeable sediments may comprise distinct microbial habitats due to their unique biogeochemical and physical characteristics. To link AOM phylotypes with seep habitats and to enable future meta-analyses we thus propose that seep environment ontology needs to be further specified.

Here we assessed the effect of high CO2/low pH on otolith shape and chemical composition of six coastal fish species (Chromis chromis, Coris julis, Diplodus vulgaris, Gobius bucchichi, Sarpa salpa, Symphodus ocellatus) in a Mediterranean shallow CO2 vent. Taking into consideration the major and trace elements found near the vent and the gradient of dissolved inorganic carbon, we compared the otolith chemical signatures of fish exposed long-term to elevated CO2 emissions and reduced pH (mean pH 7.8) against fish living in two control sites (mean pH 8.2). A number of element:Ca ratios (Na:Ca, Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Cu:Ca, Zn:Ca, Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and Pb:Ca), along with isotope ratios, were measured in otoliths (Î´13C and Î´18O) and water (Î´13CDIC) samples. Additionally, we performed otolith outline shape and morphometric analysis to evaluate the effect of high CO2/low pH. We observed species-specific responses with regards to both shape and chemical signatures. Significant differences among sites were found in otolith shape (elliptical Fourier descriptors) of G. bucchichi and D. vulgaris. Elemental and isotopic signatures were also significantly different in these site attached species, though not for the other four. Overall, the carbon isotopic composition seems a good proxy to follow pH gradient in naturally acidified area. Ultimately, besides improving our knowledge of the effects of high CO2/low pH on otoliths, the present results contribute to our understanding on their use as natural tags.

A field of shallow expulsion of hydrothermal fluids has been discovered at depths of 170â€“400Â meters off the base of the Basiluzzo Islet (Aeolian Volcanic Archipelago, Southern Tyrrhenian Sea). This area consists predominantly of both actively diffusing and inactive 1â€“3 meters-high structures in the form of vertical pinnacles, steeples and mounds covered by a thick orange to brown crust deposits hosting rich benthic fauna.

Two cruises in 2013 allowed us to monitor and sampled this novel ecosystem, certainly interesting in terms of shallow-water iron-rich site. The main objective of this work was to characterize the composition of extant communities of iron microbial mats in relation to the environmental setting and the observed patterns of macrofaunal colonization. We demonstrated that iron-rich deposits contain complex and stratified microbial communities with a high proportion of prokaryotes akin to ammonium- and iron-oxidizing chemoautotrophs, belonging to Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospira, and Zetaproteobacteria. Colonizers of iron-rich mounds, while composed of the common macrobenthic grazers, predators, filter-feeders, and tube-dwellers with no representatives of vent endemic fauna, differed from the surrounding populations. Thus, it is very likely that reduced electron donors (Fe2+ and NH4 +) are important energy sources in supporting primary production in microbial mats, which form a habitat-specific trophic base of the whole Basiluzzo hydrothermal ecosystem, including macrobenthic fauna.

To forecast the functioning of coastal seagrass ecosystems in acidified oceans, more knowledge on the long-term adaptive capacities of seagrass species and their epibionts is needed. Therefore we studied morphological characteristics of Posidonia oceanica and the structure of its epibiont communities at a Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vent off Panarea Island (Italy) and performed a laboratory experiment to test the effect of OA on P. oceanica photosynthesis and its potential buffering capacity. At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet, venting of CO2 gas was controlled by tides, resulting in an average pH difference of 0.1 between the vent and reference site. P. oceanica shoot and leaf density was unaffected by these levels of OA, although shorter leaves at the vent site suggest increased susceptibility to erosion, potentially by herbivores. The community of sessile epibionts differed in composition and was characterized by a higher species richness at the vent site, though net epiphytic calcium carbonate concentration was similar. These findings suggest a higher ecosystem complexity at the vent site, which may have facilitated the higher diversity of copepods in the otherwise unaffected motile epibiont community. In the laboratory experiment, P. oceanica photosynthesis increased with decreasing pHT (7.6, 6.6, 5.5), which induced an elevated pH at the leaf surfaces of up to 0.5 units compared to the ambient seawater pHT of 6.6. This suggests a temporary pH buffering in the diffusive boundary layer of leaves, which could be favorable for epibiont organisms. The results of this multispecies study contribute to understanding community-level responses and underlying processes in long-term acidified conditions. Increased replication and monitoring of physico- chemical parameters on an annual scale are, however, recommended to assure that the biological responses observed during a short period reflect long-term dynamics of these parameters.

To forecast the functioning of coastal seagrass ecosystems in acidified oceans, more knowledge on the long-term adaptive capacities of seagrass species and their epibionts is needed. Therefore we studied morphological characteristics of Posidonia oceanica and the structure of its epibiont communities at a Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vent off Panarea Island (Italy) and performed a laboratory experiment to test the effect of OA on P. oceanica photosynthesis and its potential buffering capacity. At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet, venting of CO2 gas was controlled by tides, resulting in an average pH difference of 0.1 between the vent and reference site. P. oceanica shoot and leaf density was unaffected by these levels of OA, although shorter leaves at the vent site suggest increased susceptibility to erosion, potentially by herbivores. The community of sessile epibionts differed in composition and was characterized by a higher species richness at the vent site, though net epiphytic calcium carbonate concentration was similar. These findings suggest a higher ecosystem complexity at the vent site, which may have facilitated the higher diversity of copepods in the otherwise unaffected motile epibiont community. In the laboratory experiment, P. oceanica photosynthesis increased with decreasing pHT (7.6, 6.6, 5.5), which induced an elevated pH at the leaf surfaces of up to 0.5 units compared to the ambient seawater pHT of 6.6.

This area hosts, among other submarine edifices, the ephemeral Ferdinandea Island, created in 1831 by an explosive eruption - the only well-documented event occurred in the study area - and rapidly dismantled by erosional processes. In the Graham Bank and its vicinity, three red coral deposits have been discovered and extensively exploited commercially during the last part of the 19th century, and were quickly depleted after discovery, since no living coral populations survived or repopulated the area after geological events that caused the massive die off. The coral deposits lay on a muddy sea-floor alongside some volcanic reliefs, and consisted of mostly dead corals, intermingled with volcanic and biogenic debris. Here, we describe these deposits and propose a model for their evolutionary history through palaeoecological analyses of their faunistic content, radiocarbon dating, Remotely Operated Vehicle sea-floor observations, and seismic profiles. Overall presented data suggest that these deposits have accumulated primarily (or even partially) as a consequence of volcanic activity dislodging living (or dead) corals from the steep flanks of volcanoes on which they lived. Periodic collapses of the friable pyroclastic walls of these edifices and landslides may have been triggered by repeated submarine eruptions, possibly associated with small earthquakes.

Chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing members of the Gammaproteobacteria (predominantly Thiotrichales) dominate the active fraction of the established microbial filaments, while Epsilonproteobacteria (predominantly Sulfurovum spp.) are more prevalent in the young filaments. This indicates a succession of the two communities, possibly in response to age, sulfide and oxygen concentrations. Growth experiments with representative laboratory strains in sulfide gradient medium revealed that Sulfurovum riftiae (Epsilonproteobacteria) grew closer to the sulfide source than Thiomicrospira sp.

Overall, our findings show that sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria are the dominant pioneer colonizers of the Tor Caldara biofilm communities and that Gammaproteobacteria become prevalent once the community is established.

Overall, our findings show that sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria are the dominant pioneer colonizers of the Tor Caldara biofilm communities and that Gammaproteobacteria become prevalent once the community is established. This succession pattern appears to be driven - among other factors - by the adaptation of Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria to different sulfide concentrations.

Research on species inhabiting naturally high pCO2 environments, such as volcanic CO2 vents, offers an opportunity to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in high pCO2 regulation. Here we investigate the relative expression of NADH dehydrogenase, sodium-hydrogen antiporter (NHE), carbonic anhydrase (CA) and paramyosin genes from two non-calcifying sibling Nereididae polychaetes species, Platynereis cfr massiliensis, collected in the shallow CO2 vents off Ischia (Italy; 40Â°43â€²52.0â€³N 13Â°57â€²46.2â€³E and 40Â°43â€²55.5â€³N 13Â°57â€²48.4â€³E), and P. dumerilii collected in an area nearby (40Â°43â€²34.51â€³N; 13Â°57â€²35.7â€³E). The origin of the worms was confirmed using restriction enzyme digest. NHE and paramyosin expressions were both significantly increased in P. dumerilii relative to the P. cfr massiliensis vent populations. Furthermore, a seven day laboratory transfer experiment to lower/higher pCO2 conditions was conducted to investigate the effects on the short term gene expression. The transfer experiment of the non-vent worms to high pCO2 conditions showed no significant effect on any of the genes analysed, however, two genes (NADH dehydrogenase and NHE) from worms of the vent population were significantly down-regulated under low pCO2. These findings will help to gain further insights into the cellular mechanisms affected by pCO2 changes in two polychaete species.

The overall results showed that J. rubens could be able to survive under predicted pH conditions even though with a reduced fitness; nevertheless physiological limits prevent the growth and survival of the species at pH 6.7. At low pH (i.e. pH 7.5), the maximum and effective PSII efficiency decreased even if the increase of Rubisco expression suggests a compensation effort of the species to cope with the decreased light-driven products. In these circumstances, a pH-driven bleaching phenomenon was also observed. Even though the photosynthesis decreased at low pH, J. rubens maintained unchanged the mineralogical composition and the carbonate content in the cell wall, suggesting that the calcification process may also have a physiological relevance in addition to a structural and/or a protective role.

Pore water, bottom water, sediment and authigenic carbonate samples were collected from two short push cores (MRS-DV5-PC04 âˆ’ 8 cm, MRS-DV5-PC01 âˆ’ 12.5 cm) at an active methane bubbling site in the southeastern part of the Ã‡inarcik Basin. Sulfate sulfur and oxygen isotope data as well as sulfide isotope data indicate that sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane is the dominant process in the sediments. This is confirmed by archaeal lipids diagnostic for anaerobic methane oxidizers detected with strong 13C-depletions. The available data even allows to distinguish the dominant AOM assemblages. Specific lipid patterns are consistent with a dominance of ANME-2 archaea within the microbial community. Abundant authigenic carbonates (mostly aragonite), found at all depths, show a narrow range in Î´13C values between âˆ’27.69â€° and âˆ’33.40â€°. The carbon isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon as well as strontium and calcium isotopes confirm that the current reaction zone (sulfate-methane transition zone) starts at the bottom of the core. All shallower carbonates are witnesses of paleo seepage activity. U-Th dating of four pure aragonite samples show the short time span that is preserved in core MRS-DV5-PC01 (235 Â± 60 yr B.P.). Two major earthquakes of 1766 CE and 1754 CE in the Ã‡inarcik Basin might potentially have triggered the increased seepage of methane at this location.

They are often covered or surrounded by patches of black Fe-sulphide-rich sediments, and associated with hydrocarbon-rich gas and brackish-water emissions in the 1250 m-deep deep basins and with deep saline formation waters and hydrocarbons emissions from mud volcanoes and anticlines on the 350â€“650 m-deep compressional highs. The authigenic carbonate crusts are commonly porous with sinter-like, botryoidal and sugary- granular textures, and constructed from cementation of framework elements consisting mainly of bivalve shells and shell fragments, serpulid tubes, fibrous microbial organic matter and rarely pebbles. The authigenic cements consist mainly of aragonite in most sites, but high Mg-calcite occurs as a major carbonate cement at some basinal sites, where the brackish former Marmara â€œLakeâ€ waters emerge. The buoyant emission of brackish waters in the deep Marmara basins and deeply sourced fluids from the Tertiary Thrace basin at the compressional highs are supported by relatively low Î´18O values (+0.5â€° to +3.8â€° V-PDB, average = +2.1â€°V-PDB, n = 24) of carbonates in the former and high values (+2.6â€° to +3.4â€° V-PDB, average = +3.0â€°, n = 9) in the latter areas. Low Î´13C values (âˆ’47.6â€° to âˆ’13.7â€° V-PDB, average: âˆ’34.9â€° V-PDB, n = 33) and close association with black reduced sediments indicate that the seafloor authigenic carbonates are formed by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at or near the seafloor, as result of high methane flux, possibly during periods of high seismic activity. Authigenic carbonates from the Western and Central highs are relatively less depleted in 13C than those of the deep basin sites, suggesting both microbial and thermogenic methane source for the deep basins carbonates and mainly thermogenic hydrocarbon, with some contribution from the biodegradation of heavy hydrocarbons and gas hydrate dissociation, for carbonates from the compressional highs. U-Th ages of the authigenic carbonates range from less than 1 ka BP to 9.6 ka BP. The age distribution, together with the geochemical and mineralogical data, suggests that different processes such as seismo-tectonics and gas hydrates destabilization might have played important role in the authigenic carbonate formation in the Sea of Marmara over the last 10 ka.

The site, located at 70â€“80 m depth off the South-western coast of the islet of Basiluzzo, was named Smoking Land for the presence of a large number of wide and high active chimneys and was characterized in terms of dissolved benthic fluxes, associated macrofauna and megafauna communities and preliminary mineralogy and geochemistry of chimney structures. On the whole field, a total of 39 chimneys, different in size and shape, were closely observed and described; 14 of them showed emission of low temperature hydrothermal fluids of marine origin characterized by acidified chemical conditions. The CTD and benthic chamber measurements highlighted that the Smoking Land is able to form a sea water bottom layer characterized by variable acidity and high DIC and trace elements concentrations; these characteristics weaken moving away from the chimney mouths. The SEM-EDS analysis of the collected solid samples revealed a chimney structure principally composed by amorphous and low crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides of hydrothermal origins. The ROV explorations revealed a wide coverage of red algae (Peyssonnelia spp.) colonized by the green algae Flabiella petiolata and by suspension feeders, mainly sponges, but also bryozoans, and tubicolous polychaetes. Although novent-exclusive species were identified, the benthic communities found in association to the chimneys included more taxa than those observed in the surrounding no-vent rocky areas. These first findings evidence a submarine dynamic habitat where geological, chemical and biological processes are intimately connected, making the Smoking Land an important site in terms of marine heritage that should be safeguarded and protected.

Here we present data from a vent field in Palaeochori Bay, Milos, Greece using a suite of biogeochemical analytical tools that captured both spatial and temporal variability in biotic and abiotic sulfur cycling. Samples were collected along a transect from a seagrass meadow to an area of active venting. The abundance and isotopic composition of sulfide captured in situ, together with geochemistry from sedimentary porewaters and the overlying water column and solid phase sulfide minerals, record evidence of ephemeral activity of microbial sulfate reduction as well as sulfide oxidation. The sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of porewater sulfates indicate active sulfate reduction within the transition zone between the vents and seagrass, rapid recycling of biologically produced sulfide within non-vent sediments, and reoxidation of abiotic sulfide within the vent field. A phylogenetic survey of sediments also indicates the pervasive presence of a suite of putative sulfur-metabolizing bacteria, including sulfate reducers and sulfide oxidizers, many of which can utilize intermediate valence sulfur compounds. The isotopic composition of pyrite in these sediments consistently records a microbially influenced signature (Î´ 34 S py of âˆ’4.4 to âˆ’10.8â€°) relative to the hydrothermal endmember (Î´ 34 S ~ + 2.5â€°), independent of distance from the vent source. The narrow range of pyrite Î´ 34 S across sediments with a highly variable hydrothermal influence suggests that physical mixing (e.g., by storm events) homogenizes the distribution of biogenic and hydrothermal Fe-sulfides throughout the region, overprinting the spatially and temporally variable interplay between biological and hydrothermal sulfur cycling in these environments.

The poor knowledge of a submarine environment, the rare and scarce monitoring activities, and the expensive and sometimes complicated logistics are the main problems to deal with. The submarine low-energy explosion, which occurred last November 3, 2002, off the volcanic island of Panarea, highlighted the absence of any hazard scenario to be used to manage the volcanic crisis. The ""unrest"" of the volcanic activity was triggered by a sudden input of deep magmatic fluids, which caused boiling water at the sea surface with a massive CO2 release besides changes in the fluids' geochemistry. That event dramatically pushed scientists to develop new methods to monitor the seafloor venting activity. Coupling the information from geochemical investigations and data collected during the unrest of volcanic activity, we were able to (a) develop theoretical models to gain a better insight on the submarine hydrothermal system and its relationships with the local volcanic and tectonic structures and (b) to develop a preliminary submarine volcanic hazard assessment connected to the Panarea system (Aeolian Islands). In order to mitigate the potential submarine volcanic hazard, three different scenarios are described here: (1) ordinary hydrothermal venting, (2) gas burst, and (3) volcanic eruption. The experience carried out at Panarea demonstrates that the best way to face any submarine volcanic-hydrothermal hazard is to improve the collection of data in near real-Time mode by multidisciplinary seafloor observatories and to combine it with periodical sampling activity.

The polychaetes Platynereis dumerilii and P. massiliensis (Nereididae) are key species of the benthic community to investigate the effect of OA due to their physiological and ecological characteristics that enable them to persist even in naturally acidified CO 2 vent systems. Previous studies have documented the ability of these species to adapt to OA after short-and long-Term translocation experiments, but no one has ever evaluated the basal antioxidant system efficiency comparing populations permanently living in habitat characterized by different pH conditions (acidified vs. control). Here, individuals of both Platynereis species, sampled from a natural CO 2 vent system and from a nonventing ""control"" site in three different periods (April 2016, October 2016, and February 2017), were compared highlighting signals which suggested the ability of both species to acclimatize to high pCO 2 -low pH with slight seasonal variations of their antioxidant efficiency and the absence of disturbances of the oxidative status of Platynereis spp.Tissues.

However, their uncommon morphology and physiology, and their roles and survival on biotic surfaces in marine environments, are only partially understood. Access to axenic cultures of different planctomycetal genera is key to study their complex lifestyles, uncommon cell biology and primary and secondary metabolism in more detail. Here, we describe the characterisation of strain Enr8T isolated from a marine biotic surface in the seawater close to the shallow-sea hydrothermal vent system off Panarea Island, an area with high temperature and pH gradients, and high availability of different sulphur and nitrogen sources resulting in a great microbial diversity. Strain Enr8T showed typical planctomycetal traits such as division by polar budding, aggregate formation and presence of fimbriae and crateriform structures. Growth was observed at ranges of 15â€“33Â Â°C (optimum 30Â Â°C), pH 6.0â€“8.0 (optimum 7.0) and at NaCl concentrations from 100 to 1200Â mM (optimum 350â€“700Â mM). Strain Enr8T forms white colonies on solid medium and white flakes in liquid culture. Its genome has a size of 6.20Â Mb and a G + C content of 59.2%. Phylogenetically, the strain belongs to the genus Blastopirellula.

We hypothesize that the perception of â€œodourâ€ produced by seagrass leaf epiphytes will change with seawater acidification, affecting the behaviour of seagrass-associated invertebrates. To test this hypothesis, we collected epiphytes from leaves of Posidonia oceanica growing at two pH conditions (7.7 and 8.1) and identified the most abundant genera of diatoms. We tested the VOCs produced at pH 8.1 by the epiphytic communities in toto, as well as those produced by selected diatoms, on various invertebrates. A complex set of species-specific and concentration-dependent chemotactic reactions was recorded, according to the pH of seawater. In particular, VOCs produced by individual diatoms triggered contrasting reactions in invertebrates, depending on the pH. The perception of epiphyte VOCs is likely to vary due to alteration of species ability to perceive and/or interpret chemical cues as infochemicals or due to changes in the structure of VOCs themselves.

The ZGP seabed displays different fluid-venting morphologies (pockmarks, lithified pavements, mounds, and cone-shaped structures) and widespread bacterial communities. In this study, we analyzed ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) images to gain information on seabed geology and the textural, mineralogical, and geochemical composition of authigenic crusts and gravel-sized clasts sampled close to active emissions. ROV images show authigenic dome-shaped crusts composed of native sulfur associated with barite, gypsum, amorphous silica, and secondary hydrothermal minerals (illiteâ€“montmorillonite). The gravel-sized clasts are mostly rhyolites strongly affected by hydrothermal alteration (Alteration Index > 88; depletion of some mobile elements and enrichment of some base metals), causing feldspar-destruction, silicification, formation of hydrothermal phyllosilicates, and precipitation of disseminated pyrite. More intense alteration implying the complete obliteration of the primary mineralogy or fabric is represented by quartz-pyrite samples. ZGP seabed morphology and petro-geochemical features of deposits point to the possible occurrence of a sulfide system linked to the degassing of magma similar to that feeding the Pleistocene products of Ponza Island.

In this study, we determined the chemical composition of 47 sediment porewater samples along a transect from a diffuse shallow-sea hydrothermal vent to a non-thermal background area in Paleochori Bay, Milos Island, Greece. These geochemical data were combined with thermodynamic calculations to quantify potential sources of energy that may support in situ chemolithotrophy. The Gibbs energies (Î”Gr) of 730 redox reactions involving 23 inorganic H-, O-, C-, N-, S-, Fe-, Mn-, and As-bearing compounds were calculated. Of these reactions, 379 were exergonic at one or more sampling locations. The greatest energy yields were from anaerobic CO oxidation with NO2- (-136 to -162 kJ/mol e-), followed by reactions in which the electron acceptor/donor pairs were O2/CO, NO3-/CO, and NO2-/H2S. When expressed as energy densities (where the concentration of the limiting reactant is taken into account), a different set of redox reactions are the most exergonic: in sediments affected by hydrothermal input, sulfide oxidation with a range of electron acceptors or nitrite reduction with different electron donors provide 85~245 J per kg of sediment, whereas in sediments less affected or unaffected by hydrothermal input, various S0 oxidation reactions and aerobic respiration reactions with several different electron donors are most energy-yielding (80~95 J per kg of sediment). A model that considers seawater mixing with hydrothermal fluids revealed that there is up to ~50 times more energy available for microorganisms that can use S0 or H2S as electron donors and NO2- or O2 as electron acceptors compared to other reactions. In addition to revealing likely metabolic pathways in the near-surface and subsurface mixing zones, thermodynamic calculations like these can help guide novel microbial cultivation efforts to isolate new species.

However, interdisciplinary research efforts on rock, sediment, water, gas, and biofilm samples collected in the Baia di Levante, Vulcano Island (Italy) have led to major discoveries in geobiology. For example, the archaeal species Pyrodictium occultum was the first isolated microorganism thriving at temperatures above 100Â°C, Aquifex and Thermotoga represent the highest temperature genera of Bacteria, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus was the first pure culture Archaeon capable of extracting metabolic energy from the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. In addition, the first large-scale assessment of in situ redox reaction energetics (potential catabolic strategies for chemolithotrophic Archaea and Bacteria) was carried out for the shallow-sea hydrothermal system at Vulcano. These and other fundamental contributions to our understanding of heat-loving (thermophilic) microorganisms in their natural habitats were facilitated by numerous detailed investigations of the aqueous geochemistry and volcanology of the Aeolian Islands.

Ocean acidification (OA), resulting from anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), is predicted to impair sensory function and behaviour of fish. However, reproductive behaviours, and parental care in particular, and their role in mediating responses to OA are presently overlooked. Here, we assessed whether the nesting male ocellated wrasse Symphodus ocellatus from sites with different CO2 concentrations showed different behaviours during their breeding season. We also investigated potential re-allocation of the time-budget towards different behavioural activities between sites. We measured the time period that the nesting male spent carrying out parental care, mating and exploring activities, as well as changes in the time allocation between sites at ambient (~400 Î¼atm) and high CO2 concentrations (~1000 Î¼atm). Whilst the behavioural connectance (i.e., the number of linkages among different behaviours relative to the total amount of linkages) was unaffected, we observed a significant reduction in the time spent on parental care behaviour, and a significant decrease in the guarding activity of fish at the high CO2 sites, with a proportional re-allocation of the time budget in favour of courting and wandering around, which however did not change between sites. This study shows behavioural differences in wild fish living off volcanic CO2 seeps that could be linked to different OA levels, suggesting that behavioural plasticity may potentially act as a mechanism for buffering the effects of ongoing environmental change.

We performed whole genome sequencing of 21 Pseudomonas strains, previously isolated from an active submarine volcano of Greece, the Kolumbo volcano. Our goal was to identify the genetic basis of the enhanced co-tolerance to antibiotics and acidity of these Pseudomonas strains. Pangenome analysis identified 10,908 Gene Clusters (GCs). It revealed that the numbers of phage-related GCs and sigma factors, which both provide the mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stressors, were much higher in the high tolerant Pseudomonas strains compared to the rest ones. All identified GCs of these strains were associated with antimicrobial and multidrug resistance. The present study provides strong evidence that the CO2-rich seawater of the volcano associated with low pH might be a reservoir of microorganisms carrying multidrug efflux-mediated systems and pumps. We, therefore, suggest further studies of other extreme environments (or ecosystems) and their associated physicochemical parameters (or factors) in the rise of antibiotic resistance.

Most of the available studies on low pH effects on coral reproduction have been conducted on tropical species under controlled conditions, while little information is reported for either tropical or temperate species in the field. This study describes the influence of decreasing pH on sexual reproduction of the temperate non-zooxanthellate colonial scleractinian Astroides calycularis, transplanted in four sites along a natural pH gradient at the underwater volcanic crater of Panarea Island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). The average pH values of each site (range: pHTS 8.07â€“7.40) match different scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the end of the century. After 3 months under experimental conditions, the reproductive parameters of both oocytes and spermaries (abundance, gonadal index, and diameters) seem to be unaffected by low pH. However, a delay in spermary development in the pre-fertilization period and a persistence of mature oocytes in the fertilization period were observed in the most acidic site. Furthermore, no embryos were found in colonies from the two most acidic sites, suggesting a delay or an interruption of the fertilization process due to acidified conditions. These findings suggest a negative effect of low pH on A. calycularis sexual reproduction. However, long-term experiments, including the synergistic impact of pH and temperature, are needed to predict if this species will be able to adapt to climate change over the next century.

To study the presence of Hg in MSWHS in Paleochori Bay (Milos Island, Greece), sea surface, bottom, pore fluid and hydrothermal gas samples were collected in June of 2017, October of 2018 and July of 2020, and analyzed for Cl, Br, SO4, As, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, Sr, H2S, unfiltered total Hg (THg), and filtered Hg (Hgdiss). Specific sites were selected for the analysis of volatile elemental Hg (Hgo), dimethylmercury (DMHg), monomethylmercury (MMHg), and Hg in the gas phase (Hggas). Concentrations of THg observed in samples collected from the sea surface were elevated compared to surface samples taken outside Paleochori Bay. The highest surface water concentrations (~10 to 15 pM) were measured in samples collected directly above shallow-water hydrothermal discharge areas. Pore fluids outside Paleochori Bay were significantly lower in THg (0.8 to 8.6 pM) than those taken inside (17.4 to 1511 pM). Porewaters collected from areas with visible gaseous or fluid emission were highly variable but generally elevated in THg concentrations (185 to 5066 pM). Concentrations within gases ranged from 0.7 to 2791 nmol/m3. The vast majority of samples with highly elevated THg (&gt; 100 pM) had low Na/K ratios (&lt; 15), indicative of rapidly rising fluid. Concentrations of Hg0, DMHg, and MMHg were below detection limits in all samples. Bottom substrate type (e.g., rocky vs. sediment covered) likely affected infiltration rates of oxygenated seawater below the sediment-water interface, thereby affecting Hg speciation and removal by precipitation. Flux rates from porewaters compared to those with gaseous emission were high (12.56 to 1088 mol THg/year and 0.37 to 1.85 mol THg/year). Sites with slow gaseous emission rates are hypothesized to have extended subsurface reaction times, resulting in lower Hg concentrations emitted to bottom waters. However, increasing rates of gas emission did not necessarily indicate higher Hg concentrations. The scavenging of Hg in the sediments and advective flux out of Paleochori Bay likely prevent significant accumulations of THg in the water column of Paleochori Bay. The total atmospheric flux from Paleochori Bay using average flux calculations over the entire surface area would contribute 6 mmol Hg/year to the atmosphere. We hypothesize that Hg concentrations within the pore fluids of Paleochori Bay reflect a balance between mixing and precipitation in the subsurface. A three-component mixing system of vapor, brine and seawater determines THg concentrations; however, precipitation due to sulfur cycling, changes in redox conditions and temperature, all play a crucial role in removing Hg from emitted fluids and gases.

The health of seagrass ecosystems is influencedÂ in part by the makeup and stability of their microbiome, but microbiome composition can be sensitive to environmental change such as nutrient availability, elevated temperatures, and reduced pH. The objective of the present study was to characterize the bacterial community of the leaves, bulk samples of roots and rhizomes, and proximal sediment of the seagrass species Cymodocea nodosa along the natural pH gradient of Levante Bay, Vulcano Island, Italy. The bacterial community was determined by characterizing the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analyzing the operational taxonomic unit classification of bacterial DNA within samples. Statistical analyses were used to explore how life-long exposure to different pH/pCO2 conditions may be associated with significant differences in microbial communities, dominant bacterial classes, and microbial diversity within each plant section and sediment. The microbiome of C. nodosa significantly differed among all sample types and site-specific differences were detected within sediment and root/rhizome microbial communities, but not the leaves. These results show that C. nodosa leaves have a consistent microbial community even across a pH range of 8.15 to 6.05. The ability for C. nodosa to regulate and maintain microbial structure may indicate a semblance of resilience within these vital ecosystems under projected changes in environmental conditions such as ocean acidification.

For this purpose, an integrated research methodology that combined geophysical, geochemical, and hydrographic surveys was applied. Marine geophysical and bathymetric surveys led to the discovery of a gas-induced pockmark group in the study area. Oceanographic surveying confirmed that the bay is hypoxic/anoxic below a depth of 15 m (dissolved oxygen from ~4 to 60 ÂµM). Very weak CH4 seepage was detected in correspondence to the pockmark group that seemed to slightly enhance the hypoxic environment locally and close to the seabed, with no effect in shallower waters and the oxycline. Methane isotopic analysis showed variable carbon isotopic composition (from âˆ’41â€° to âˆ’86â€°) which could be either related to differential CH4 oxidation or mixing between microbial and thermogenic gas. However, the pathway of degassing is clearly related to the fault-controlled pockmark group. A protrusion mound, which has erroneously been reported as a submarine â€œvolcanoâ€ since 1876, could be the result of mud volcanism based on the geophysical data of this study.

Volcaniclastic detritus recovered from the seafloor is cemented by hydrothermal pyrite and marcasite, while semi-massive to massive pyrite-marcasite constitute mounds and chimney-like edifices. Paragenetic relationships indicate deposition of two distinct mineralogical assemblages related to the venting of high-Cl and low-Cl fluids, respectively: (1) colloform As-and Hg-bearing pyrite (Py I), associated with marcasite, calcite, and apatite, as well as (2) porous and/or massive As-rich pyrite (Py II), associated with barite, alunite/jarosite, and late-stage hydrous ferric oxides. Mercury, in the form of cinnabar, occurs within the As-rich pyrite (Py I) layers, usually forming distinct cinnabar-enriched micro-layers. Arsenic in colloform pyrite I shows a negative correlation with S indicating that As1âˆ’ dominates in the pyrite structure suggesting formation from a relatively reducing As-rich fluid at conditions similar to low-sulfidation epithermal systems. On the contrary, As3+ dominates in the structure of porous to massive pyrite II suggesting deposition from a sulfate-dominated fluid with lower pH and higher fO2. Bulk sulfide data of pyrite-bearing hydrothermal precipitates also show elevated As (up to 2587 ppm) together with various epithermal-type elements, such as Sb (up to 274 ppm), Tl (up to 513 ppm), and Hg (up to 34 ppm) suggesting an epithermal nature for the hydrothermal activity at Paleochori Bay. Textural relationships indicate a contemporaneous deposition of As and Hg, which is suggested to be the result of venting from both high-salinity, liquid-dominated, as well as CO2-and H2S-rich vapor-dominated fluids that formed during fluid boiling. The CO2-and H2S-rich vapor that physically separated during fluid boiling from the high-salinity liquid led to calcite formation upon condensation in seawater together with the precipitation of As-and Hg-bearing pyrite I. This also led to the formation of sulfuric acid, thereby causing leaching and dissolution of primary iron-rich minerals in the volcaniclastic sediments, finally resulting in pyrite II precipitation in association with alunite/jarosite. The Paleochori vents contain the first documented occurrence of cinnabar on the seafloor in the Mediterranean area and provide an important link between offshore hydrothermal activity and the onshore mercuryarsenic mineralizing system on Milos Island. The results of this study therefore demonstrate that metal and metalloid precipitation in shallow-water continental arc environments is controlled by epithermal processes known from their subaerial analogues.
